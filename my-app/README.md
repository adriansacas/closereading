# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Docker

### Run the container and bind mount the volumes

This allows us to sync our project directory `/my-app/src` with the `/app/src` directory in our docker container. Therefore, any changes we make in our project directories will be reflected in our docker container without having to rebuild the image.

`docker run -it -v <path to project src>:/app/src:ro -d -p 3000:3000 --name frontend idb/react`

## Docker Compose

### Run the containers (backend, frontend)

Run this command from the project root directory.

`docker-compose up -d`

Access through http://localhost:3000/

### Stop the containers

`docker-compose down`

### Build image

When running docker-compose for the first time, it will build an image. However, docker-compose does not know when it needs to rebuild the image. All it does is check that the images with the correct name is there.

Run this command if rebuilding the image is needed. For example when dependencies change, or the dockerfile has been modified.

`docker-compose up -d --build`
