Starting with a comparison of basic similarities and differences between literature and music, the study goes on to provide outlines of a general theory of intermediality and its fundamental forms, in which a more specialized theory of the musicalization of (narrative) literature based on contemporary narratology and a typology of the forms of musico-literary intermediality are embedded. It also addresses the question of how to recognize a musicalized fiction when reading one and why Sterne's Tristram Shandy, contrary to what has been previously said, is not to be regarded as a musicalized fiction. In its historical part, the study explores forms and functions of experiments with the musicalization of fiction in English literature. After a survey of the major preconditions for musicalization - the increasing appreciation of music in 18th and 19th-century aesthetics and its main causes - exemplary fictional texts from romanticism to postmodernism are analyzed. Authors interpreted are De Quincey, Joyce, Woolf, A. Huxley, Beckett, Burgess and Josipovici. Whilst the limitations of a transposition of music into fiction remain apparent, experiments in this field yield valuable insights into mainly a-mimetic and formalist aesthetic tendencies in the development of more recent fiction as a whole and also show to what extent traditional conceptions of music continue to influence the use of this medium in literature. The volume is of relevance for students and scholars of English, comparative and general literature as well as for readers who take an interest in intermediality or interart research.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9042004576"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789042004573"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 292, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.5.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&as_brr=5&as_ebook=1&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5qar3j-cx4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10.63, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8.5, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&rdid=book-p5qar3j-cx4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10630000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8500000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Musicalization_of_Fiction-sample-pdf.acsm?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&hl=&as_brr=5&as_ebook=1&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This volume is a pioneering study in the theory and history of the imitation of music in fiction and constitutes an important contribution to current intermediality research."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CK-K28AUwr8C", "etag": "55mgxDGtbMo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CK-K28AUwr8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How Fiction Works", "authors": ["James Wood"], "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "publishedDate": "2008-07-22", "description": "What makes a story a story?

This question has long compelled the attention of storytellers and students of literature alike, and over the past several decades it has opened up broader dialogues about the nature of culture and interpretation. This third edition of the bestselling Essentials of the Theory of Fiction provides a comprehensive view of the theory of fiction from the nineteenth century through modernism and postmodernism to the present. It offers a sample of major theories of fictional technique while emphasizing recent developments in literary criticism. The essays cover a variety of topics, including voice, point of view, narration, sequencing, gender, and race. Ten new selections address issues such as oral memory in African American fiction, temporality, queer theory, magical realism, interactive narratives, and the effect of virtual technologies on literature. For students and generalists alike, Essentials of the Theory of Fiction is an invaluable resource for understanding how fiction works. Contributors. M. M.

In particular, fiction has been defined in terms of the imagination: what it is for something to be fictional is that there is some requirement that a reader imagine it. Derek Matravers argues that this rests on a mistake; the proffered definitions of 'the imagination' do not link it with fiction but with representations more generally. In place of the flawed consensus, he offers an account of what it is to read, listen to, or watch a narrative whether that narrative is fictional or non-fictional. The view that emerges, which draws extensively on work in psychology, downgrades the divide between fiction and non-fiction and largely dispenses with the imagination. In the process, he casts new light on a succession of issues: on the 'paradox of fiction', on the issue of fictional narrators, on the problem of 'imaginative resistance', and on the nature of our engagement with film.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780191018060"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0191018066"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fiction&hl=&as_brr=5&as_ebook=1&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 34.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 19.24, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BkdmAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 34990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19240000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Fiction_and_Narrative-sample-epub.acsm?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Fiction_and_Narrative-sample-pdf.acsm?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BkdmAwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=5&as_ebook=1&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Derek Matravers argues that this rests on a mistake; the proffered definitions of &#39;the imagination&#39; do not link it with fiction but with representations more generally."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "a2CBAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "2QqK/3i/W5I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/a2CBAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Narrative Fiction", "subtitle": "Contemporary Poetics", "authors": ["Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2003-12-16", "description": "What is a narrative? What is narrative fiction? How does it differ from other kinds of narrative? What featuers turn a discourse into a narrative text? Now widely acknowledged as one of the most significant volumes in its field, Narrative Fiction turns its attention to these and other questions. In contrast to many other studies, Narrative Fiction is organized arround issues - such as events, time, focalization, characterization, narration, the text and its reading - rather than individual theorists or approaches. Within this structure, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan addresses key approaches to narrative fiction, including New Criticism, formlaism, structuralism and phenomenology, but also offers views of the modifications to these theroies. While presenting an analysis of the system governing all fictional narratives, whether in the form of novel, short story or narrative poem, she also suggests how individual narratives can be studied against the background of this general system. A broad range of literary examples illustrate key aspects of the study. This edition is brought fully up-to-date with an invaluable new chapter, reflecting on recent developments in narratology. Readers are also directed to key recent works in the field.

This book explains how precious fiction is to contemporary women readers, and how they draw on it to tell the stories of their lives. Female readers are key to the future of fiction and\u2014as parents, teachers, and librarians\u2014the glue for a literate society. Women treasure the chance to read alone, but have also gregariously shared reading experiences and memories with mothers, daughters, grandchildren, and female friends. For so many, reading novels and short stories enables them to escape and to spread their wings intellectually and emotionally. This book, written by an experienced teacher, scholar of women's writing, and literature festival director, draws on over 500 interviews with and questionnaires from women readers and writers. It describes how, where, and when British women read fiction, and examines why stories and writers influence the way female readers understand and shape their own life stories. Taylor explores why women are the main buyers and readers of fiction, members of book clubs, attendees at literary festivals, and organisers of days out to fictional sites and writers' homes. The book analyses the special appeal and changing readership of the genres of romance, erotica, and crime. It also illuminates the reasons for British women's abiding love of two favourite novels, Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre. Taylor offers a cornucopia of witty and wise women's voices, of both readers themselves and also writers such as Hilary Mantel, Helen Dunmore, Katie Fforde, and Sarah Dunant.
