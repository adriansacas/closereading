It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, \"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\" As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage and compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in English-speaking countries with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms. Often the book is challenged for its use of racial epithets, and writers have noticed that regardless of its popularity since its publication, some readers are displeased by the novel's treatment of black characters. Lee's novel was initially reviewed by at least 30 newspapers and magazines, whose critics varied widely in their assessments. More recently, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \"every adult should read before they die.\" The book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. To date, it is Lee's only published novel, and although she continues to respond to the book's impact, she has refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1523812699"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781523812691"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 2114, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=872PjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=872PjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=872PjwEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Harper+Lee%22&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=872PjwEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Harper+Lee%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird.html?hl=&id=872PjwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=872PjwEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot; The book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote.

This ebook has been designed and formatted to the highest digital standards and adjusted for readability on all devices. American novelist and short story writer Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804\u20131864) published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828; he later tried to suppress it, feeling it was not equal to the standard of his later work. He published several short stories in various periodicals, which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. Much of Hawthorne's writing centres on New England, many works featuring moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered to be part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, Dark romanticism. His themes often centre on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity.

The epic romance tale set in and around Atlanta, Georgia during the American Civil War has remained a bestseller, even before the equally popular film starring Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh was made in 1939. The novel has also been described as an early classic of the erotic historical genre, because it is thought to contain some degree of pornography. The novel tells of archetypal Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara as she grows from a young woman into maturity against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Like many of the early 20th century Southern writers, Mitchell portrays an idyllic image of the antebellum South.

Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Poe was born in Boston, the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to \"a Bostonian\". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan. Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Richmond in 1836, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents. Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "197838498X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781978384989"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 162, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=maw_tAEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Edgar+Allen+Poe%22&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=maw_tAEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Edgar+Allen+Poe%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Complete_Poetical_Works_of_Edgar_All.html?hl=&id=maw_tAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=maw_tAEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country&#39;s earliest practitioners of the short story."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cM-NDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "iHMLZHoBUhc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cM-NDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Edgar Allan Poe's The Pit and the Pendulum", "authors": ["Edgar Allen Poe"], "publisher": "Bluewater Productions", "publishedDate": "2015-11-17", "description": "The Pit and the Pendulum is an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s classic story of condemnation, hope and redemption.

Speaking from her heart on a wide range of topics--religion and the spirit, feminism and race, families and identity, politics and social change--Walker begins with a moving autobiographical essay in which she describes her own spiritual growth and roots in activism. She goes on to explore many important private and public issues: being a daughter and raising one, dreadlocks, banned books, civil rights, and gender communication.

I found myself unmoored, unmated, ungrounded in a way that challenged everything I'd ever thought about human relationships. Situated squarely in that terrifying paradise called freedom, precipitously out on so many emotional limbs, it was as if I had been born; and in fact I was being reborn as the woman I was to become.\" So says Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker about her beautiful new book, in which \"one of the best American writers today\" (The Washington Post) gives us superb stories based on rich truths from her own experience. Imbued with Walker's wise philosophy and understanding of people, the spirit, sex and love, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart begins with a lyrical, autobiographical story of a marriage set in the violent and volatile Deep South during the early years of the civil rights movement. Walker goes on to imagine stories that grew out of the life following that marriage\u2014a life, she writes, that was \"marked by deep sea-changes and transitions.\" These provocative stories showcase Walker's hard-won knowledge of love of many kinds and of the relationships that shape our lives, as well as her infectious sense of humor and joy. Filled with wonder at the power of the life force and of the capacity of human beings to move through love and loss and healing to love again, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart is an enriching, passionate book by \"a lavishly gifted writer\" (The New York Times Book Review).", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307816962"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307816966"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Alice+Walker%22&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&rdid=book-sgiLhGNNA_wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Way_Forward_Is_with_a_Broken_Heart-sample-epub.acsm?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sgiLhGNNA_wC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot;These are the stories that came to me to be told after the close of a magical marriage to an extraordinary man that ended in a less-than-magical divorce."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6-QASZEb0YsC", "etag": "UFkyEtkgYug", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6-QASZEb0YsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Everyday Use", "authors": ["Alice Walker"], "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "publishedDate": "1994", "description": "Presents the text of Alice Walker's story \"Everyday Use\"; contains background essays that provide insight into the story; and features a selection of critical response.

The story is told as if the reader was overhearing the patter of Bob Slocum's brain -- recording what is going on at the office, as well as his fantasies and memories that complete the story of his life. The result is a novel as original and memorable as his Catch-22.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307803610"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307803619"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 576, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 12, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Joseph+Heller%22&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b2AiWB98p5sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&rdid=book-b2AiWB98p5sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/SOMETHING_HAPPENED-sample-epub.acsm?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=b2AiWB98p5sC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The story is told as if the reader was overhearing the patter of Bob Slocum&#39;s brain -- recording what is going on at the office, as well as his fantasies and memories that complete the story of his life."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "3gSTtgAACAAJ", "etag": "MLG7YDPUarc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3gSTtgAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Catch-22", "authors": ["Joseph Heller", "Christopher Buckley"], "publisher": "Perfection Learning", "publishedDate": "2011-04", "description": "The impossible and illogical adventures of the 256th bombing squadron and its lead bombardier.

It all began one typical day in the life of Joe Heller. He was jogging four miles at a clip these days, working on his novel God Knows, coping with the complications of an unpleasant divorce, and pigging out once or twice a week on Chinese food with cronies like Mel Brooks, Mario Puzo, and his buddy of more than twenty years, Speed Vogel. He was feeling perfectly fine that day\u2014but within twenty-four hours he would be in intensive care at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital. He would remain hospitalized for nearly six months and leave in a wheelchair. Joseph Heller had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a debilitating, sometimes fatal condition that can leave its victims paralyzed from head to toe. The clan gathered immediately. Speed\u2014sometime artist, sometime businessman, sometime herring taster, and now a coauthor\u2014moved into Joe's apartment as messenger, servant, and shaman. Mel Brooks, arch-hypochondriac of the Western world, knew as much about Heller's condition as the doctors. Mario Puzo, author of the preeminent gangster novel of our time, proved to be the most reluctant man ever to be dragged along on a hospital visit. These and lots of others rallied around the sickbed in a show of loyalty and friendship that not only built a wild and spirited camaraderie but helped bring Joe Heller, writer and buddy extraordinaire, through his greatest crisis. This book is an inspiring, hilarious memoir of a calamitous illness and the rocky road to recuperation\u2014as only the author of Catch-22 and the friend who helped him back to health could tell it. No Laughing Matter is as wacky, terrifying, and greathearted as any fiction Joseph Heller ever wrote.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780743272612"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0743272617"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Joseph+Heller%22&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&rdid=book-1eQ13q0MCoUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/No_Laughing_Matter-sample-epub.acsm?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book is an inspiring, hilarious memoir of a calamitous illness and the rocky road to recuperation\u2014as only the author of Catch-22 and the friend who helped him back to health could tell it."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0NGb6oS3DIcC", "etag": "OnMsMLHNF68", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0NGb6oS3DIcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Picture This", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["Joseph Heller"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2000-03-24", "description": "\"As Rembrandt is creating his famous painting of Aristotle contemplating the bust of Homer, Aristotle is soon able to see and hear.

Theater scholar Susan C. W. Abbotson introduces this volume as a selection of Miller\u2019s finest essays, organized in three thematic parts: essays on the theater, essays on specific plays like Death of a Salesman and The Crucible, and sociopolitical essays on topics spanning from the Depression to the twenty-first century. Written with playful wit, clear-eyed intellect, and above all, human dignity, these essays offer unmatched insight into the work of Arthur Miller and the turbulent times through which he guided his country.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing: \"Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\" For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

This rich cross-section of his work includes poems from throughout Whitman's lifetime as published on his deathbed edition of 1891, short stories, his prefaces to the many editions of Leaves of Grass, and a variety of prose selections, including Democratic Vistas, Specimen Days, and Slang in America.

He's proud of his reputation, but what he wants most of all is to be just like his older brother, the Motorcycle Boy. Whenever Rusty-James gets in over his head, the Motorcycle Boy has always been there to bail him out. Then one day Rusty-James' world comes apart, and the Motorcycle boy isn't around to pick up the pieces. What now?

TAMING THE STAR RUNNER written by celebrated novelist S.E. Hinton, now available as an eBook for the first time. With an absent mother and a domineering step-father, Travis uses his tough-guy exterior to hide his true passion: writing. After a violent confrontation with his step-father, Travis is sent to live on his uncle\u2019s horse ranch - exile to a born-and-bred city kid. Angry and yearning for a connection, Travis befriends Casey, the horse-riding instructor at the ranch, and the un-tamable horse in her stable: the Star Runner. When a friend from the city visits with stories of other kids from the neighborhood facing jail time, Travis is more determined than ever that he needs to escape the life of juvenile delinquency he seems destined for. When the offer of a book deal comes through, Travis is hopeful that this is his chance to escape, if only his step-father will stop standing in the way of his dreams. From the author of THE OUTSIDERS, S.E. Hinton once again writes about what it feels like to be unaccepted, and the power in being true to yourself. \u201cHinton continues to grow more reflective in her books, but her great understanding, not of what teenagers are but of what they can hope to be, is undiminished.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews An ALA Best Books for Young Adults An ALA Quick Pick", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781938120831"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1938120833"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 193, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22S.E.+Hinton%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WAagKwp08Z0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&rdid=book-WAagKwp08Z0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Taming_the_Star_Runner-sample-epub.acsm?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Taming_the_Star_Runner-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WAagKwp08Z0C&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this novel, the acclaimed author of The Outsiders \u201cportrays her characters with sympathy and yet commendably refuses to gloss over rough edges or gritty truths\u201d (Publishers Weekly). \u201cHinton continues to grow more reflective in her ..."}}]}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 54, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WToh-xW3cfoC", "etag": "MmxZPnZ6CRM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WToh-xW3cfoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sometimes a Great Notion", "authors": ["Ken Kesey"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "2006-08-29", "description": "The magnificent second novel from the legendary author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Following the astonishing success of his first novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ken Kesey wrote what Charles Bowden calls \"one of the few essential books written by an American in the last half century.\" This wild-spirited tale tells of a bitter strike that rages through a small lumber town along the Oregon coast.

It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of \"iron eyes and backbone to match.\" Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. Sethe works at \"beating back the past,\" but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' \"desolated center where the self that was no self made its home.\" And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D (\"There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep\"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the \"place over there\" to claim retribution for what she lost and for what was taken from her. Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance.

Angelou writes of celebrations public and private, a bar mitzvah wish to her nephew, a birthday greeting to Oprah Winfrey, and a memorial tribute to the late Luther Vandross and Barry White.

"Highlighting a lesser-known aspect of one of America's most influential authors, this new collection displays Jack Kerouac's interest in and mastery of haiku. Experimenting with this compact poetic genre throughout his career, Kerouac often included haiku in novels, correspondence, notebooks, journals, sketchbooks, and recordings. In this collection, Kerouac scholar Regina Weinreich supplements an incomplete draft of a haiku manuscript found in Kerouac's archives with a generous selection of Kerouac's other haiku, from both published and unpublished sources. With more than 500 poems, this is a must-have volume for Kerouac enthusiasts everywhere.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780142002643"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "014200264X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 243, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Poetry"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.5.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Jack+Kerouac%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Jack+Kerouac%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Book_of_Haikus.html?hl=&id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Highlighting a lesser-known aspect of one of America&#39;s most influential authors, this new collection displays Jack Kerouac&#39;s interest in and mastery of haiku."}}]}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 84, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "id": "YfNgYQdWw0gC", "etag": "M/IE7yPvgPo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YfNgYQdWw0gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Until I Find You", "authors": ["John Irving"], "publisher": "Vintage Canada", "publishedDate": "2009-02-24", "description": "Until I Find You is the story of the actor Jack Burns \u2013 his life, loves, celebrity and astonishing search for the truth about his parents. When he is four years old, Jack travels with his mother Alice, a tattoo artist, to several North Sea ports in search of his father, William Burns. From Copenhagen to Amsterdam, William, a brilliant church organist and profligate womanizer, is always a step ahead \u2013 has always just departed in a wave of scandal, with a new tattoo somewhere on his body from a local master or \u201cscratcher.\u201d Alice and Jack abandon their quest, and Jack is educated at schools in Canada and New England \u2013 including, tellingly, a girls\u2019 school in Toronto. His real education consists of his relationships with older women \u2013 from Emma Oastler, who initiates him into erotic life, to the girls of St. Hilda\u2019s, with whom he first appears on stage, to the abusive Mrs. Machado, whom he first meets when sent to learn wrestling at a local gym. Too much happens in this expansive, eventful novel to possibly summarize it all. Emma and Jack move to Los Angeles, where Emma becomes a successful novelist and Jack a promising actor. A host of eccentric minor characters memorably come and go, including Jack\u2019s hilariously confused teacher the Wurtz; Michelle Maher, the girlfriend he will never forget; and a precocious child Jack finds in the back of an Audi in a restaurant parking lot. We learn about tattoo addiction and movie cross-dressing, \u201csleeping in the needles\u201d and the cure for cauliflower ears. And John Irving renders his protagonist\u2019s unusual rise through Hollywood with the same vivid detail and range of emotions he gives to the organ music Jack hears as a child in European churches. This is an absorbing and moving book about obsession and loss, truth and storytelling, the signs we carry on us and inside us, the traces we can\u2019t get rid of. Jack has always lived in the shadow of his absent father. But as he grows older \u2013 and when his mother dies \u2013 he starts to doubt the portrait of his father\u2019s character she painted for him when he was a child. This is the cue for a second journey around Europe in search of his father, from Edinburgh to Switzerland, towards a conclusion of great emotional force. A melancholy tale of deception, Until I Find You is also a swaggering comic novel, a giant tapestry of life\u2019s hopes. It is a masterpiece to compare with John Irving\u2019s great novels, and restates the author\u2019s claim to be considered the most glorious, comic, moving novelist at work today.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307371348"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307371344"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 848, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 26, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfNgYQdWw0gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfNgYQdWw0gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YfNgYQdWw0gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22John+Irving%22&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YfNgYQdWw0gC&dq=inauthor:%22John+Irving%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Until_I_Find_You.html?hl=&id=YfNgYQdWw0gC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Until_I_Find_You-sample-epub.acsm?id=YfNgYQdWw0gC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YfNgYQdWw0gC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Until I Find You is the story of the actor Jack Burns \u2013 his life, loves, celebrity and astonishing search for the truth about his parents."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QdX4qW-Y7FwC", "etag": "I/lfbqoFvDE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QdX4qW-Y7FwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Cider House Rules", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["John Irving"], "publisher": "Modern Library", "publishedDate": "1999-11-03", "description": "First published in 1985, The Cider House Rules is John Irving's sixth novel.

If San Francisco has captured the world's imagination through the hardboiled stories of Dashiell Hammett, the prose and poetry of Jack Kerouac and his fellow Beats, through Orson Welles' Lady From Shanghai and Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, it is as a romantic city of vast suspension bridges and foggy back alleys, not as the wild west of Jack London's day. Pre-quake San Francisco was a tough town, and Jack London - hobo, sailor, oyster pirate, hard drinker - was pretty tough, too. Although famous for his stories of the Klondike and the Pacific, London wrote extensively about his home base. This collection contains such classic stories as 'The Apostate' and 'South of the Slot' as well as extracts from John Barleycorn and The Sea-Wolf. The overlooked 1905 story cycle Tales of the Fish Patrol is included in its entirety. London's vivid eyewitness report of the Great 1906 Earthquake and Fire - which destroyed forever the old city - stands as a fitting epilogue. Discover a vanished San Francisco in these wonderful stories of Jack London. Selected as one of the 16 BOOKS TO READ IF YOU LOVE SAN FRANCISCO: \"Most of us know San Francisco as a soft foggy charmfest of a city. But it wasn't always so tame. Jack London's San Francisco Stories chronicles the tougher annals of SF's pre-earthquake days, and includes Jack London's firsthand account of the city burning in the wake of the 1906 quake.

Set in San Francisco, this is the story of Martin Eden, an impoverished seaman who pursues, obsessively and aggressively, dreams of education and literary fame. London, dissatisfied with the rewards of his own success, intended Martin Eden as an attack on individualism and a criticism of ambition; however, much of its status as a classic has been conferred by admirers of its ambitious protagonist. Andrew Sinclair's wide-ranging introduction discusses the conflict between London's support of socialism and his powerful self-will. Sinclair also explores the parallels and divergences between the life of Martin Eden and that of his creator, focusing on London's mental depressions and how they affected his depiction of Eden.

By Sorrow\u2019s River continues the Berrybender party\u2019s trail across the endless Great Plains of the West toward Santa Fe, where they intend, those who are lucky enough to survive the journey, to spend the winter. They meet up with a vast array of characters from the history of the West: Kit Carson, the famous scout; Le Partezon, the fearsome Sioux war chief; two aristocratic Frenchmen whose eccentric aim is to cross the Great Plains by hot air balloon; a party of slavers; a band of raiding Pawnee; and many other astonishing characters who prove, once again, that the rolling, grassy plains are not, in fact, nearly as empty of life as they look. Most of what is there is dangerous and hostile, even when faced with Tasmin\u2019s remarkable, frosty sangfroid. She is one of the strongest and most interesting of Larry McMurtry\u2019s women characters, and is at the center of this powerful and ambitious novel of the West.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781451607703"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1451607709"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Larry+McMurtry%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xbde3ihPM6EC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&rdid=book-xbde3ihPM6EC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/By_Sorrow_s_River-sample-epub.acsm?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xbde3ihPM6EC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this tale of high-spirited and terrifying adventure, set against the background of the West that Larry McMurtry has made his own, By Sorrow\u2019s River is an epic in its own right with the return of the formidable, young Tasmin Berrybender ..."}}]}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 13, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QwBQEAAAQBAJ", "etag": "rrpYrWbM6JY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QwBQEAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Help", "authors": ["Kathryn Stockett"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "2011-04-05", "description": "The #1 New York Times bestselling novel and basis for the Academy Award-winning film\u2014a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don\u2019t\u2014nominated as one of America\u2019s best-loved novels by PBS\u2019s The Great American Read.

Nineteen years ago, Dave Cullen was among the first to arrive at Columbine High, even before most of the SWAT teams went in. While writing his acclaimed account of the tragedy, he suffered two bouts of secondary PTSD. He covered all the later tragedies from a distance, working with a cadre of experts cultivated from academia and the FBI, but swore he would never return to the scene of a ghastly crime. But in March 2018, Cullen went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School because something radically different was happening. In nearly twenty years witnessing the mass shootings epidemic escalate, he was stunned and awed by the courage, anger, and conviction of the high school\u2019s students. Refusing to allow adults and the media to shape their story, these remarkable adolescents took control, using their grief as a catalyst for change, transforming tragedy into a movement of astonishing hope that has galvanized a nation. Cullen unfolds the story of Parkland through the voices of key participants whose diverse personalities and outlooks comprise every facet of the movement. Instead of taking us into the mind of the killer, he takes us into the hearts of the Douglas students as they cope with the common concerns of high school students everywhere\u2014awaiting college acceptance letters, studying for mid-term exams, competing against their athletic rivals, putting together the yearbook, staging the musical Spring Awakening, enjoying prom and graduation\u2014while moving forward from a horrific event that has altered them forever. Deeply researched and beautifully told, Parkland is an in-depth examination of this pivotal moment in American culture\u2014and an up-close portrait that reveals what these extraordinary young people are like. As it celebrates the passion of these astonishing students who are making history, this spellbinding book is an inspiring call to action for lasting change.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type":

Now, writing with the same sharp, richly expressive language, the same edgy dark humor and complete honesty, and the same rawness of nerve and energy, Tim O\u2019Brien gives us an equally powerful novel about growing up as a child of anxiety\u2014the big anxiety, the one that\u2019s been with us since the fifties, when we finally realized that Einstein\u2019s theories translated into Russian. It\u2019s 1995 and William Cowling is digging a hole in his backyard. He is forty-nine, and after years and years of pent-up terror he has finally found the courage of a fighting man. And so a hole. A hold that he hopes will one day be large enough to swallow up his almost fifty years\u2019 worth of fear. A hole that causes his twelve-year-old daughter to call him a \u201cnutto,\u201d and his wife to stop speaking to him. A hole that William will not stop digging and out of which rise scenes of his past to play themselves out in his memory. The scenes take him back to his quietly peculiar adolescence (No. 2 pencils had a surprising significance), to his college days, down into the underground, and up through several stabs at \u201cnormal\u201d adulthood . . . they take him from Montana to Florida, from Cuba to California, from Kansas to New York to Germany and back to Montana as he makes him way through an often mystifying\u2014but just as often hilarious \u2014labyrinth of fears and desires, obsessions and obligations, blessed madness and less-than-blessed sobriety . . . they take him into the lives of a shrink who\u2019s a whiz a role reversal and of a dizzying eccentric cheerleader; of radical misfits and misfit radicals; of an ethereal stewardess (the traveling man\u2019s dream); and two guerilla commandos who mix shtick and nightmare in their tactical brew. And each scene is a reminder of the unbargained-for-terror that has guided him to the bottom of his hole. For this digging is his final act of \u201cprudence and sanity\u201d\u2014he\u2019s taking control, getting there first, robbing his fears of their power to destroy . . . or so he believes. But is this act really sane? Is his daughter\u2019s estimation of his emotional well-being (\u201cpretty buggo, too\u201d) the only truly sane statement being made? Is sanity even the issue? In the dazzling final scenes, William turns from the hole\u2014from his past and from his future 0 to himself, digging deeper and deeper to find his answers. The Nuclear Age is pyrotechnically funny and moving, courageous and irreverent. It takes on our supreme unacknowledged terror (whose reality we both refuse to accept and all too easily accommodate ourselves to), finds it lunatic core, and shapes it into a story that speaks of, and to, an entire age: our own, our nuclear age. It is an extraordinary novel.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307829689"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307829685"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Tim+O%27Brien%22&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&rdid=book-ZPmfa1QWx9IC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Nuclear_Age-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZPmfa1QWx9IC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Going After Cacciato (winner of the National Book Award in 1979) was widely acclaimed as one of the most powerful and emotionally vivid novels about Vietnam."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4OK2YxpfUtsC", "etag": "F6/o1LDXJOQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4OK2YxpfUtsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Going After Cacciato", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["Tim O'Brien"], "publisher": "Crown", "publishedDate": "2009-02-18", "description": "A CLASSIC FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE THINGS THEY CARRIED \"To call Going After Cacciato a novel about war is like calling Moby-Dick a novel about whales.\" So wrote The New York Times of Tim O'Brien's now classic novel of Vietnam.

His historical romances of frontier and Indian life in the early American days created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was established by his father William. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and in his later years contributed generously to it. He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society, but was expelled for misbehavior. Before embarking on his career as a writer he served in the U.S. Navy as a Midshipman which greatly influenced many of his novels and other writings. He is best remembered as a novelist who wrote numerous sea-stories and the historical novels known as the Leatherstocking Tales. Among naval historians Cooper's works on the early U.S. Navy have been well received, but they were sometimes criticized by his contemporaries. Among his most famous works is the Romantic novel The Last of the Mohicans, often regarded as his masterpiece.

Collected here in a single Library of America volume, they are among his finest works. Bold, vigorous, original, each is a tale of high adventure that vividly captures the majesty and power of the seafaring life. Cooper drew on his direct knowledge of ships and sailors to present a truer picture of life on the sea than had ever before achieved in literature. As a boy of seventeen he had sailed before the mast on a merchantman bound from New York to London and then to Spain. On board he experienced the life of a common seaman, learned the craft of sailing, encountered terrifying storms, was chased by pirates, and watched the impressment of crew members by a British man-of-war. He later served as an officer in the United States Navy. The Pilot is loosely based upon stories of John Paul Jones\u2019s daring hit-and-run tactics during the Revolutionary War. The shadowy hero, modeled on Jones, leads a squadron of the infant American navy in a series of raids on the English coast, braving fierce storms and the guns of hostile warships, yet never revealing his identity. In this novel Cooper introduced the character of the \u201cold salt,\u201d the seasoned deckhand happy only aboard ship. Long Tom Coffin, with his briny conversation and shrewd nautical advice, is the first of Cooper\u2019s memorable portraits of common seaman. A ghostly ship, an uncanny hero, a heroine kidnapped by pirates, revelations of mistaken identity, and the reunion of long-lost relatives\u2014scenes of romance and adventure fill the pages of The Red Rover, Cooper\u2019s most theatrical novel. Set in the mid-eighteenth century, the tale recounts the exploits of a noble outcast and visionary who foresees America\u2019s destiny as a sovereign nation. Forced into a life of piracy, the Rover conducts his private war of independence in a story that equates the free and daring life with the American dream of self-reliance and liberty from British rule.

His historical romances of frontier and Indian life in the early American days created a unique form of American literature. Before embarking on his career as a writer, Cooper served in the U.S. Navy, which greatly influenced many of his novels. The novel that launched his career was The Spy, tale of espionage in Revolutionary War. He also wrote numerous sea stories, and his best-known works are five historical novels of the frontier period known as the Leatherstocking Tales. Among his most famous works is the Romantic novel The Last of the Mohicans.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "EAN:8596547003144"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 12924, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22James+Fenimore+Cooper%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ffdyEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/James_Fenimore_Cooper_Ultimate_Collectio-sample-epub.acsm?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/James_Fenimore_Cooper_Ultimate_Collectio-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ffdyEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This unique collection of James Fenimore Cooper&#39;s greatest works includes:_x000D_ The Deerslayer_x000D_ The Last of the Mohicans_x000D_ The Pathfinder_x000D_ The Pioneers_x000D_ The Prairie_x000D_ The Littlepage Manuscripts:_x000D_ ..."}}]}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 106, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "id": "f2ieoAEACAAJ", "etag": "ExJ0nudE5EY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/f2ieoAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Hunger Games", "authors": ["Suzanne Collins"], "publishedDate": "2014-10-01", "description": "First in the ground-breaking HUNGER GAMES trilogy.

His omniscient eye took in the surfaces of cities, the nuances of speech, dress, and manner, and, above all, the microscopic interactions, hesitancies, betrayals, and self-betrayals that are the true substance of relationships. The entirely new Portable Henry James provides an unparalleled range of this great body of work: seven major tales, including Daisy Miller, The Turn of the Screw, \"The Beast in the Jungle,\" and \"The Jolly Corner\"; a sampling of revisions James made to some of his most famous work; travel writing; literary criticism; correspondences; autobiography; descriptions of the major novels; and parodies by famous contemporaries, including T.

Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and \"the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick.\" Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning.

In his novels and stories, in letters to editors, friends, fellow artists, and critics, in interviews and in commissioned articles on the subject, Hemingway wrote often about writing. And he wrote as well and as incisively about the subject as any writer who ever lived\u2026 This book contains Hemingway\u2019s reflections on the nature of the writer and on elements of the writer\u2019s life, including specific and helpful advice to writers on the craft of writing, work habits, and discipline. The Hemingway personality comes through in general wisdom, wit, humor, and insight, and in his insistence on the integrity of the writer and of the profession itself. \u2014From the Preface by Larry W.

The circumstances of the interviews did not seem to matter much to O'Connor; her approach and demeanor remained consistent. Her self-knowledge was always apparent, in her confidence in herself, in her enterprise as a writer, and in her beliefs. She could penetrate the surfaces; she could see things in depth. Her perceptions were wide-ranging and insightful. Her interviews, given sparingly but with careful reflection and precision, make a unique contribution to an understanding of her fiction and to the evolving narrative of her short but influential life.

Press of Mississippi", "publishedDate": "1986", "description": "In 1953 Flannery O'Connor was so pleased by Brainard Cheney's review of her much misunderstood first novel Wise Blood that she wrote the reviewer to thank him. What Cheney, himself a novelist, had said about the book was right on target. Very soon a friendship between this rising star of southern literature and Brainard and Frances Cheney was flourishing. Over the next eleven years there was a spirited exchange of letters and visits. Whenever possible, the Cheneys stopped by Andalusia, the O'Connor farm near Milledgeville, Georgia, and O'Connor was able to visit them at Cold Chimneys, their home in Smyrna, Tennessee. This fascinating book collecting their correspondence reveals a devoted friendship that ended with Flannery O'Connor's death at thirty-nine in 1964. In these 188 letters, all previously unpublished, we see a new aspect of her life, the part she shared with \"Lon\" and \"Fannie\" Cheney. These letters not only give the pleasure of knowing more about the talented Cheneys, an eminent couple close to the Tate circle, but also provide yet another occasion for readers to revel in the delight of Flannery O' Connor's sparkling wit and dark humor. From O'Connor there are 117 letters, from Cheney 71. All Mrs. Cheney's letters to Flannery have been lost, but from the surviving correspondence the reader can note with pleasure the interests that seemed to draw this trio closer as they shared opinions and reports about their native South, their Roman Catholicism, their novels in progress, and their commitment to good writing. But it is chiefly the literary illuminations via these letters that enhance the friendship as well as ignite the reader's compelling curiosity. The letters focus attention upon a time in Flannery O'Connor's life when correspondence was of great importance to her. The O'Connor/Cheney letters make it clear that her circumscribed life was enlarged and enriched by this friendship during her most creative and productive years. - Jacket flap.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1604731664"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781604731668"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.5.7.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=itqZjEF0DpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=itqZjEF0DpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=itqZjEF0DpsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Flannery+O%27Connor%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=itqZjEF0DpsC&dq=inauthor:%22Flannery+O%27Connor%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Correspondence_of_Flannery_O_Connor.html?hl=&id=itqZjEF0DpsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=itqZjEF0DpsC&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This fascinating book collecting their correspondence reveals a devoted friendship that ended with Flannery O&#39;Connor&#39;s death at thirty-nine in 1964."}}]}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 0}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 200, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sr3bEI3iYusC", "etag": "wMkno2KVOBI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sr3bEI3iYusC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Complete Shorter Fiction of Herman Melville", "subtitle": "Introduction by John Updike", "authors": ["Herman Melville"], "publisher": "Everyman's Library", "publishedDate": "1997-10-15", "description": "Herman Melville (1819-91) brought as much genius to the smaller-scale literary forms as he did to the full-blown novel: his poems and the short stories and novellas collected in this volume reveal a deftness and a delicacy of touch that is in some ways even more impressive than the massive, tectonic passions of Moby-Dick.

In the sorrowful tragedy of Billy Budd, Sailor; the controlled rage of Benito Cereno; and the tantalizing enigma of Bartleby, the Scrivener; Melville reveals himself as a singular storyteller of tremendous range and compelling power. In these stories, Melville cuts to the heart of race, class, capitalism, and globalism in America, deftly navigating political and social issues that resonate as clearly in our time as they did in Melville\u2019s. Also including The Piazza Tales in full, this collection demonstrates why Melville stands not only among the greatest writers of the nineteenth century, but also as one of our greatest contemporaries.

Novels and poetry followed, but it was with the story collection Winesburg, Ohio that he found his ideal form, remaking the American short story for the modern era. Hart Crane, one of the first to recognize Anderson\u2019s genius, quickly hailed his accomplishment: \u201cAmerica should read this book on her knees.\u201d Here\u2013\u2013for the first time in a single volume\u2013\u2013are all the collections Anderson published during his lifetime: Winesburg, Ohio (1919), The Triumph of the Egg (1921), Horses and Men (1923), and Death in the Woods (1933), along with a generous selection of stories left uncollected or unpublished at his death. Exploring the hidden recesses of small town life, these haunting, understated, often sexually frank stories pivot on seemingly quiet moments when lives change, futures are recast, and pasts come to reckon. They transformed the tone of American storytelling, inspiring writers like Hemingway, Faulkner, and Mailer, and defining a tradition of midwestern fiction that includes Charles Baxter, editor of this volume.

This collection of more than a dozen pieces showcases the young Capote developing the unique voice and sensibility that would make him one of the twentieth century\u2019s most original writers. Spare yet heartfelt, these stories summon our compassion and feeling at every turn. Capote was always drawn to outsiders\u2014women, children, African Americans, the poor\u2014because he felt like one himself from a very early age. Here we see Capote\u2019s powers of empathy developing as he depicts his characters struggling at the margins of their known worlds. A boy experiences the violence of adulthood when he pursues an escaped convict into the woods. Petty jealousies lead to a life-altering event for a popular girl at Miss Burke\u2019s Academy for Young Ladies. In a time of extraordinary loss, a woman fights to save the life of a child who has her lover\u2019s eyes. In these stories we see early signs of Capote\u2019s genius for creating unforgettable characters built of complexity and yearning. Young women experience the joys and pains of new love. Urbane sophisticates are worn down by cynicism. Children and adults alike seek understanding in a treacherous world. There are tales of crime and violence; of racism and injustice; of poverty and despair. And there are tales of generosity and tenderness; compassion and connection; wit and wonder. Above all there is the developing voice of a writer born in the Deep South who will use and eventually break from that tradition to become a literary figure like no other. With a foreword by the celebrated New Yorker critic Hilton Als, this volume of early stories is essential for understanding how a boy from Monroeville, Alabama, became a legend in American literature. Praise for The Early Stories of Truman Capote \u201cSucceeds at conveying the writer\u2019s youthful rawness . . .

Hugh Holman Award A central figure in twentieth-century American literature, Robert Penn Warren (1905\u20131989) was appointed by the Library of Congress as the first Poet Laureate of the United States in 1985. Although better known for his fiction, especially his novel All the King\u2019s Men, it is mainly his poetry\u2014spanning sixty years, fifteen volumes of verse, and a wide range of styles\u2014that reveals Warren to be one of America\u2019s foremost men of letters. In this indispensable volume, John Burt, Warren\u2019s literary executor, has assembled every poem Warren ever published (with the exception of Brother to Dragons), including the many poems he published in The Fugitive and other magazines, as well as those that appeared in his small press works and broadsides. Burt has also exhaustively collated all of the published versions of Warren\u2019s poems\u2014which, in some cases, appeared as many as six different times with substantive revisions in every line\u2014as well as his typescripts and proofs. And since Warren never seemed to reread any of his books without a pencil in his hand, Burt has referred to Warren\u2019s personal library copies. This comprehensive edition also contains textual notes, lists of emendations, and explanatory notes. Warren was born and raised in Guthrie, Kentucky, where southern agrarian values and a predilection for storytelling were ingrained in him as a young boy. By 1925, when he graduated from Vanderbilt University, he was already the most promising of that exceptional set of poets and intellectuals known as the Fugitives. Warren devoted most of the 1940s and 1950s to writing prose and literary criticism, but from the late 1950s he composed primarily poetry, with each successive volume of verse that he penned demonstrating his rigorous and growing commitment to that genre.

fiction or nonfiction had before) and turning John Berendt into a household name. The City of Falling Angels is Berendt's first book since Midnight, and it immediately reminds one what all the fuss was about. Turning to the magic, mystery, and decadence of Venice, Berendt gradually reveals the truth behind a sensational fire that in 1996 destroyed the historic Fenice opera house.

Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0679449442"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780679449447"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 167, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=xxgLkgEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22John+Berendt%22&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=xxgLkgEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22John+Berendt%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Midnight_in_the_Garden_of_Good_and_Evil.html?hl=&id=xxgLkgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xxgLkgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The enormously engaging account of life and death in secluded and hauntingly beautiful Savannah, Georgia, continues to take America by storm. &quot;Mr. Berendt&#39;s writing is elegant and wickedly funny, and his eye for telling details is superb."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4NwqnwEACAAJ", "etag": "SFv6jBC50yM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4NwqnwEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "City of Falling Angels Hb Header", "authors": ["John Berendt"], "publishedDate": "2005-09-26", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0340891505"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780340891506"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4NwqnwEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22John+Berendt%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4NwqnwEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22John+Berendt%22&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/City_of_Falling_Angels_Hb_Header.html?hl=&id=4NwqnwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4NwqnwEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]}, {"kind": "books#volumes", "totalItems": 77, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QiXMxUifFs8C", "etag": "0tsSNFFJbUg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QiXMxUifFs8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Shadow and Act", "authors": ["Ralph Ellison"], "publisher": "Vintage", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01", "description": "With the same intellectual incisiveness and supple, stylish prose he brought to his classic novel Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison examines his antecedents and in so doing illuminates the literature, music, and culture of both black and white America.

The latter novel zeroed in on the town of Gopher Prairie; the former stopped there briefly and then took the reader by automobile in search of America. Free Air heads toward a West that was brimming with possibilities for suddenly mobile Americans at the end of a world war. The vehicle in Lewis\u2019s novel, not a Model T but a Gomez-Dep roadster, takes Claire Boltwood and her father from Minnesota to Seattle, exposing them all to the perils of early motoring. On the road, the upper-crust Boltwoods are at once more insignificant and more noble. The greatest distance to be overcome is the social one between Claire and a young mechanic named Milt, who, with a cat as his traveling companion, follows close behind. If Free Air anticipates many of the themes of Lewis\u2019s later novels, it also looks forward to a genre that includes John Steinbeck\u2019s Travels with Charley and Josh Greenfeld and Paul Mazursky\u2019s Harry and Tonto.

She soon finds herself mixed up with a drug runner in an art deco motorboat, a professional nose obsessed with Hitler\u2019s aftershave, a neoliberal enforcer with footwear issues, plus elements of the Russian mob and various bloggers, hackers, code monkeys, and entrepreneurs, some of whom begin to show up mysteriously dead. Foul play, of course. With occasional excursions into the DeepWeb and out to Long Island, Thomas Pynchon, channeling his inner Jewish mother, brings us a historical romance of New York in the early days of the internet, not that distant in calendar time but galactically remote from where we\u2019ve journeyed to since. Will perpetrators be revealed, forget about brought to justice? Will Maxine have to take the handgun out of her purse? Will she and Horst get back together? Will Jerry Seinfeld make an unscheduled guest appearance? Will accounts secular and karmic be brought into balance? Hey. Who wants to know?

Here -- with a carefully considered selection of his extraordinary body of work, chosen by a range of great writers, critics, and those who worked with him most closely. This volume presents his most dazzling, funniest, and most heartbreaking work -- essays like his famous cruise-ship piece, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" excerpts from his novels The Broom of the System, Infinite Jest, and The Pale King, and legendary stories like \"The Depressed Person.\" Wallace's explorations of morality, self-consciousness, addiction, sports, love, and the many other subjects that occupied him are represented here in both fiction and nonfiction.

The result is one of the most eloquent and revelatory interviews of Baldwin\u2019s career, a conversation that ranges widely over such topics as his childhood in Harlem, his close friendship with Miles Davis, his relationship with writers like Toni Morrison and Richard Wright, his years in France, and his ever-incisive thoughts on the history of race relations and the African-American experience.

Available for the first time in a stand-alone edition, Nothing Personal is Baldwin\u2019s deep probe into the American condition. Considering the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020\u2014which were met with tear gas and rubber bullets the same year white supremacists entered the US Capitol with little resistance, openly toting flags of the Confederacy\u2014Baldwin\u2019s documentation of his own troubled times cuts to the core of where we find ourselves today. Baldwin\u2019s thoughts move through an interconnected range of questions, from America\u2019s fixation on eternal youth, to its refusal to recognize the past, its addiction to consumerism, and the lovelessness that fuels it in its cities and popular culture. He recounts his own encounter with police in a scene disturbingly similar to those we see today documented with ever increasing immediacy. This edition also includes a new foreword from interdisciplinary scholar Imani Perry and an afterword from noted Baldwin scholar Eddie S. Glaude Jr. Both explore and situate the essay within the broader context of Baldwin\u2019s work, the Movement for Black Lives, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the presidency of Donald Trump. Nothing Personal is both a eulogy and a declaration of will.

"publishedDate": "2016-05-03", "description": "Based off of the bestselling author's family history, this novel tells the story of Kunta Kinte, who is sold into slavery in the United States where he and his descendants live through major historic events. When Roots was first published forty years ago, the book electrified the nation: it received a Pulitzer Prize and was a #1 New York Times bestseller for 22 weeks. The celebrated miniseries that followed a year later was a coast-to-coast event-over 130 million Americans watched some or all of the broadcast. In the four decades since then, the story of the young African slave Kunta Kinte and his descendants has lost none of its power to enthrall and provoke. Now, Roots once again bursts onto the national scene, and at a time when the race conversation has never been more charged. It is a book for the legions of earlier readers to revisit and for a new generation to discover. To quote from the introduction by Michael Eric Dyson: \"Alex Haley's Roots is unquestionably one of the nation's seminal texts. It affected events far beyond its pages and was a literary North Star.... Each generation must make up its own mind about how it will navigate the treacherous waters of our nation's racial sin. And each generation must overcome our social ills through greater knowledge and decisive action. Roots is a stirring reminder that we can achieve these goals only if we look history squarely in the face.\" The star- studded cast in this new event series includes Academy Award-winners Forest Whitaker and Anna Paquin, Laurence Fishburne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Derek Luke, Grammy Award-winner Tip \"T.I.\" Harris, and Mekhi Phifer. Questlove of The Roots is the executive music producer for the miniseries's stirring soundtrack.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306824869"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306824868"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 912, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.8.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Alex+Haley%22&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NH20CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12990000, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Roots-sample-epub.acsm?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NH20CwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Based off of the bestselling author&#39;s family history, this novel tells the story of Kunta Kinte, who is sold into slavery in the United States where he and his descendants live through major historic events."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oYcYx6eD7asC", "etag": "E/QSHprrVT8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oYcYx6eD7asC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Different Kind of Christmas", "authors": ["Alex Haley"], "publisher": "Gramercy", "publishedDate": "2000", "description": "This is a very special novel that sparkles with the same memorable writing that made ROOTS an American classic.

The time is 1855, and all Fletcher Randall knows and believes about slavery he's learned from his father. But Fletcher goes to school up North, and one or two of his Princeton classmates talk about how wrong slavery is until Fletcher begins to think for himself --and he becomes a traitor to his background, to his family, by conspiring to aid in a mass escape of slaves on the Underground Railroad. His partner in this plan is a black slave by the name of Harpin' John, a man who plays the harmonica so sweetly it could make a grown man cry. Christmas Eve is the secret date set for the escape. How these two men of such incredibly opposing backgrounds join together to achieve the goal of freedom makes A Different Kind of Christmas soar with unforgettable inspiration.

They live in a world shaped by casual nihilism, passivity, and too much money in a place devoid of feeling or hope. When Clay comes home for Christmas vacation from his Eastern college, he re-enters a landscape of limitless privilege and absolute moral entropy, where everyone drives Porsches, dines at Spago, and snorts mountains of cocaine. He tries to renew feelings for his girlfriend, Blair, and for his best friend from high school, Julian, who is careering into hustling and heroin. Clay's holiday turns into a dizzying spiral of desperation that takes him through the relentless parties in glitzy mansions, seedy bars, and underground rock clubs and also into the seamy world of L.A. after dark.

Lauren changes boyfriends every time she changes majors and still pines for Victor who split for Europe months ago and she might or might not be writing anonymous love letter to ambivalent, hard-drinking Sean, a hopeless romantic who only has eyes for Lauren, even if he ends up in bed with half the campus, and Paul, Lauren's ex, forthrightly bisexual and whose passion masks a shrewd pragmatism. They waste time getting wasted, race from Thirsty Thursday Happy Hours to Dressed To Get Screwed parties to drinks at The Edge of the World or The Graveyard.

and sweeping\u201d (The Washington Post) new novel in the epic Outlander series. War leaves nobody alone. Neither the past, the present, nor the future offers true safety, and the only refuge is what you can protect: your family, your friends, your home. Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years of loss and heartbreak to find each other again. Now it\u2019s 1779, and Claire and Jamie are finally reunited with their daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children, and are rebuilding their home on Fraser\u2019s Ridge\u2014a fortress that may shelter them against the winds of war as well as weather. But tensions in the Colonies are great: Battles rage from New York to Georgia and, even in the mountains of the backcountry, feelings run hot enough to boil Hell\u2019s teakettle. Jamie knows that loyalties among his tenants are split and it won\u2019t be long before the war is on his doorstep. Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking the perils of the 1700s\u2014among them disease, starvation, and an impending war\u2014was indeed the safer choice for their family. Not so far away, young William Ransom is coming to terms with the mysteries of his identity, his future, and the family he\u2019s never known.

After too long an absence, Jamie Fraser is coming home to Scotland\u2014but not without great trepidation. Though his beloved godfather, Murtagh, promised Jamie\u2019s late parents he\u2019d watch over their brash son, making good on that vow will be no easy task. There\u2019s already a fat bounty on the young exile\u2019s head, courtesy of Captain Black Jack Randall, the sadistic British officer who\u2019s crossed paths\u2014and swords\u2014with Jamie in the past. And in the court of the mighty MacKenzie clan, Jamie is a pawn in the power struggle between his uncles: aging chieftain Colum, who demands his nephew\u2019s loyalty\u2014or his life\u2014and Dougal, war chieftain of Clan MacKenzie, who\u2019d sooner see Jamie put to the sword than anointed Colum\u2019s heir.

But even as Jamie\u2019s heart draws him to Claire, Murtagh is certain she\u2019s been sent by the Old Ones, and Captain Randall accuses her of being a spy.

It is 2001 in New York City, in the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of September 11th. Silicon Alley is a ghost town, Web 1.0 is having adolescent angst, Google has yet to IPO, Microsoft is still considered the Evil Empire. There may not be quite as much money around as there was at the height of the tech bubble, but there\u2019s no shortage of swindlers looking to grab a piece of what\u2019s left. Maxine Tarnow is running a nice little fraud investigation business on the Upper West Side, chasing down different kinds of small-scale con artists. She used to be legally certified but her license got pulled a while back, which has actually turned out to be a blessing because now she can follow her own code of ethics\u2014carry a Beretta, do business with sleazebags, hack into people\u2019s bank accounts\u2014without having too much guilt about any of it. Otherwise, just your average working mom\u2014two boys in elementary school, an off-and-on situation with her sort of semi-ex-husband Horst, life as normal as it ever gets in the neighborhood\u2014till Maxine starts looking into the finances of a computer-security firm and its billionaire geek CEO, whereupon things begin rapidly to jam onto the subway and head downtown. She soon finds herself mixed up with a drug runner in an art deco motorboat, a professional nose obsessed with Hitler\u2019s aftershave, a neoliberal enforcer with footwear issues, plus elements of the Russian mob and various bloggers, hackers, code monkeys, and entrepreneurs, some of whom begin to show up mysteriously dead. Foul play, of course. With occasional excursions into the DeepWeb and out to Long Island, Thomas Pynchon, channeling his inner Jewish mother, brings us a historical romance of New York in the early days of the internet, not that distant in calendar time but galactically remote from where we\u2019ve journeyed to since. Will perpetrators be revealed, forget about brought to justice? Will Maxine have to take the handgun out of her purse? Will she and Horst get back together? Will Jerry Seinfeld make an unscheduled guest appearance? Will accounts secular and karmic be brought into balance? Hey. Who wants to know?

A Penguin Vitae Edition When Kate Chopin's classic was first published in 1899, charges of sordidness and immorality seemed to consign it into obscurity and irreparably damage its author's reputation. But a century after her death, The Awakening is widely regarded as Kate Chopin's great achievement and a celebrated work of early feminist literature. Through careful, subtle changes of style, Chopin shows the transformation of Edna Pontellier, a young wife and mother, who - with tragic consequences - refuses to be caged by married and domestic life, and claims for herself moral and erotic freedom. Penguin Classics launches a new hardcover series with five American classics that are relevant and timeless in their power, and part of a dynamic and diverse landscape of classic fiction and nonfiction from almost seventy-five years of classics publishing.

essential novel in the canon of early feminism\u2014with an introduction by Carmen Maria Machado, award-winning author of Her Body and Other Parties. \u201cWhatever came, she had resolved never again to belong to another than herself.\u201d With its forthright treatment of sex and depression, The Awakening, first published in 1899, was so shocking to turn-of-the-century readers that it was neglected for decades. Rediscovered in the 1960s, this brief, beautiful novel is considered a landmark of early feminism. It is the story of Edna Pontellier, a twenty-eight-year-old wife and mother of two who\u2014with devastating consequences\u2014rejects her conventional married life for a transgressive path of self-discovery. Edna is vacationing with her husband and children on the Louisiana Gulf Coast when she meets and falls in love with the passionate, impulsive Robert Lebrun. Afterward, Edna can no longer find meaning and satisfaction in her comfortable domestic life and moves out, alone. Her tragic quest for personal, creative, and erotic freedom is at the heart of this now-classic novel which captures women\u2019s desires with extraordinary frankness, sympathy, and intensity.

It grew into an impassioned and thoughtful book. As he wryly notes, \"If you want everyone to love you, don't discuss Israeli politics.\" But discuss them is very much what he does. Through quick sketches and vignettes, Bellow evokes places, ideas, and people, reaching a sharp picture of contemporary Israel. The reader is offered a wonderful panorama of an ancient and modern world city. Like every other visitor to Israel, Bellow tumbles into \"a gale of conversation.\" He loves it and he makes the reader feel at home. Bellow delights in the liveliness, the gallantry of Israeli life: people on the edge of history, an inch from disaster, yet brimming with argument and words. He delights not in tourist delusions but with a tough critical spirit: his Israel is pocked with scars and creases, and all the more attractive for it. Simply as a travel book, the reader finds remarkable descriptions, such as one in which Bellow finds \"the melting air\" of Jerusalem pressing upon him \"with an almost human weight\" Something intelligible is communicated by the earthlike colors of this most beautiful of cities. The impression that Bellow offers is that living in Israel must be as exhausting as it is exciting: a murderous barrage on the nerves. Israel, he writes, \"is both a garrison state and a cultivated society, both Spartan and Athenian. It tries to do everything, to make provisions for everything. All resources, all faculties are strained. Unremitting thought about the world situation parallels the defense effort.\" Jerusalem's people are actively and individually involved in universal history.

In this landmark volume, America's preeminent storyteller offers us one hundred treasures from alifetime of words and ideas -- tales that amaze, enthrall, and horrify; breathtaking journeys backward and forward in time; classic stories with the undiminished power to tantalize, mystify, elate, and move the reader to tears. Each small gem in the master's collection remains as dazzling as when it first appeared in print. There is magic in these pages: the wonders of interstellar flight, a conspiracy of insects, the early bloom of love in the warmth of August. Both the world of Ray Bradbury and its people are vivid and alive, as colorfully unique as a poker chip hand-painted by a brilliant artist or as warmly familiar as the well-used settings on a family's dining room table. In a poor man's desire for the stars, in the twisted night games of a hateful embalmer, in a magnificent fraud perpetrated to banish despair and repair a future, in a writer's wonderful death is the glowing proof of the timeless artistry of one of America's greatest living bards. The one hundred stories in this volume were chosen by Bradbury himself, and span a career that blossomed in the pulp magazines of the early 1940s and continues to flourish in the new millennium. Here are representatives of the legendary author's finest works of short fiction, including many that have not been republished for decades, all forever fresh and vital, evocative and immensely entertaining.
