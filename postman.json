It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, \\\"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\\\" As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage and compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in English-speaking countries with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms. Often the book is challenged for its use of racial epithets, and writers have noticed that regardless of its popularity since its publication, some readers are displeased by the novel's treatment of black characters. Lee's novel was initially reviewed by at least 30 newspapers and magazines, whose critics varied widely in their assessments. More recently, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \\\"every adult should read before they die.\\\" The book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. To date, it is Lee's only published novel, and although she continues to respond to the book's impact, she has refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.\",\n      \"genre\": null,\n      \"id\": 3,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=872PjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 192,\n      \"pub_year\": 2016,\n      \"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"Harper Lee\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Required reading in most high schools, this Pulitzer Prize winning novel was originally published in 1969 and was voted the best book of the century by Library Journal.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 4,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=o7qjPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 312,\n      \"pub_year\": 1991,\n      \"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"Harper Lee\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"From celebrated Pulitzer Prize-winning author Harper Lee, her bestselling novels To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman available together in this convenient e-book bundle.

But Hawthorne was highly - often wickedly - unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader's imagination. Written in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s, these works are informed by themes that reappear in Hawthorne's longer works: The Scarlet Letter, The House of the Seven Gables and The Blithedale Romance.

Gone with the Wind is often placed in the literary subgenre of the historical romance novel. The epic romance tale set in and around Atlanta, Georgia during the American Civil War has remained a bestseller, even before the equally popular film starring Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh was made in 1939. The novel has also been described as an early classic of the erotic historical genre, because it is thought to contain some degree of pornography. The novel tells of archetypal Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara as she grows from a young woman into maturity against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Like many of the early 20th century Southern writers, Mitchell portrays an idyllic image of the antebellum South. While it can be legitimately criticized for its insensitivity to the treatment of African Americans who were enslaved, Mitchell's novel demonstrates how the South was decimated by the Civil War and continued to suffer under the Northern-sanctioned Restoration.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 24,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2ubIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": null,\n      \"pub_year\": 2020,\n      \"title\": \"Gone with the Wind\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 6,\n        \"name\": \"Margaret Mitchell\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Provides insight to the author of \\\"Gone With the Wind\\\" through a collection of her early journalism for the Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine, including interviews and columns that reflect life in Atlanta during the 1920's.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Biography & Autobiography\",\n      \"id\": 25,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=EThbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 360,\n      \"pub_year\": 2000,\n      \"title\": \"Margaret Mitchell\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 6,\n        \"name\": \"Margaret Mitchell\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The author's letters to an old flame and photographs accompany a romantic saga of a stormy love triangle and characters torn between passion and honor, whose lives are forever altered by a terrible catastrophe.

In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin--that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own. On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 28,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=DMFcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": null,\n      \"pub_year\": 2016,\n      \"title\": \"Gone With The Wind\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 7,\n        \"name\": \"Louisa May Alcott\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The passionate supporter of abolition and women's rights speaks out on the most controversial issues of the day.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 29,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=6g6kwxBDzxoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 172,\n      \"pub_year\": 1997,\n      \"title\": \"Louisa May Alcott on Race, Sex, and Slavery\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 7,\n        \"name\": \"Louisa May Alcott\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Gathers letters, diary entries, and short stories that reveal aspects of the American writer's complex personality\",\n      \"genre\": \"Biography & Autobiography\",\n      \"id\": 30,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=LzZaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 369,\n      \"pub_year\": 1997,\n      \"title\": \"Louisa May Alcott\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 12,\n        \"name\": \"Emily Dickinson\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Share in Dickinson\\u2019s admiration of language, nature, and life and death, with The Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Literary Criticism\",\n      \"id\": 58,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=uaxVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 243,\n      \"pub_year\": 2022,\n      \"title\": \"The Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 13,\n        \"name\": \"Stephen King\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"In 1985, six men and one woman are called back together to search for a creature of unspeakable evil that had stalked them as children.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 59,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=S85NCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 1184,\n      \"pub_year\": 2016,\n      \"title\": \"It\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 7,\n        \"name\": \"Louisa May Alcott\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Louisa May Alcott was an American novelist and poet best known as the author of the novel Little Women (1868) and its sequels Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886). Raised by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott in New England, she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. Nevertheless, her family suffered severe financial difficulties and Alcott worked to help support the family from an early age. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard and under it wrote novels for young adults. Published in 1868, Little Women is set in the Alcott family home, Hillside, later called the Wayside, in Concord, Massachusetts and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The novel was very well received and is still a popular children's novel today, filmed several times. Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life. She died in Boston on March 6, 1888.

Something Happened is Joseph Heller's wonderfully inventive and controversial second novel satirizing business life and American culture.

It all began one typical day in the life of Joe Heller. He was jogging four miles at a clip these days, working on his novel God Knows, coping with the complications of an unpleasant divorce, and pigging out once or twice a week on Chinese food with cronies like Mel Brooks, Mario Puzo, and his buddy of more than twenty years, Speed Vogel. He was feeling perfectly fine that day\\u2014but within twenty-four hours he would be in intensive care at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital. He would remain hospitalized for nearly six months and leave in a wheelchair. Joseph Heller had Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome, a debilitating, sometimes fatal condition that can leave its victims paralyzed from head to toe. The clan gathered immediately. Speed\\u2014sometime artist, sometime businessman, sometime herring taster, and now a coauthor\\u2014moved into Joe's apartment as messenger, servant, and shaman. Mel Brooks, arch-hypochondriac of the Western world, knew as much about Heller's condition as the doctors. Mario Puzo, author of the preeminent gangster novel of our time, proved to be the most reluctant man ever to be dragged along on a hospital visit. These and lots of others rallied around the sickbed in a show of loyalty and friendship that not only built a wild and spirited camaraderie but helped bring Joe Heller, writer and buddy extraordinaire, through his greatest crisis. This book is an inspiring, hilarious memoir of a calamitous illness and the rocky road to recuperation\\u2014as only the author of Catch-22 and the friend who helped him back to health could tell it. No Laughing Matter is as wacky, terrifying, and greathearted as any fiction Joseph Heller ever wrote.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Biography & Autobiography\",\n      \"id\": 41,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1eQ13q0MCoUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 336,\n      \"pub_year\": 2004,\n      \"title\": \"No Laughing Matter\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 9,\n        \"name\": \"Joseph Heller\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"A darkly comic and ambitious sequel to the American classic Catch-22.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \\\"witch-hunts\\\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing: \\\"Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\\\" For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

To give a new voice to the new nation shaken by civil war, he spent his entire life revising and adding to the work, but his initial act of bravado in answering Ralph Waldo Emerson's call for a national poet has made Whitman the quintessential American writer.

Women saw him and wanted to weep\\\"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the \\\"place over there\\\" to claim retribution for what she lost and for what was taken from her. Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance. In Beloved, Toni Morrison has given us a great American novel.

With more than 500 poems, this is a must-have volume for Kerouac enthusiasts everywhere.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Poetry\",\n      \"id\": 105,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=n1MBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 243,\n      \"pub_year\": 2003,\n      \"title\": \"Book of Haikus\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 23,\n        \"name\": \"John Irving\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Until I Find You is the story of the actor Jack Burns \\u2013 his life, loves, celebrity and astonishing search for the truth about his parents. When he is four years old, Jack travels with his mother Alice, a tattoo artist, to several North Sea ports in search of his father, William Burns. From Copenhagen to Amsterdam, William, a brilliant church organist and profligate womanizer, is always a step ahead \\u2013 has always just departed in a wave of scandal, with a new tattoo somewhere on his body from a local master or \\u201cscratcher.\\u201d Alice and Jack abandon their quest, and Jack is educated at schools in Canada and New England \\u2013 including, tellingly, a girls\\u2019 school in Toronto. His real education consists of his relationships with older women \\u2013 from Emma Oastler, who initiates him into erotic life, to the girls of St. Hilda\\u2019s, with whom he first appears on stage, to the abusive Mrs. Machado, whom he first meets when sent to learn wrestling at a local gym. Too much happens in this expansive, eventful novel to possibly summarize it all. Emma and Jack move to Los Angeles, where Emma becomes a successful novelist and Jack a promising actor. A host of eccentric minor characters memorably come and go, including Jack\\u2019s hilariously confused teacher the Wurtz; Michelle Maher, the girlfriend he will never forget; and a precocious child Jack finds in the back of an Audi in a restaurant parking lot. We learn about tattoo addiction and movie cross-dressing, \\u201csleeping in the needles\\u201d and the cure for cauliflower ears. And John Irving renders his protagonist\\u2019s unusual rise through Hollywood with the same vivid detail and range of emotions he gives to the organ music Jack hears as a child in European churches. This is an absorbing and moving book about obsession and loss, truth and storytelling, the signs we carry on us and inside us, the traces we can\\u2019t get rid of. Jack has always lived in the shadow of his absent father. But as he grows older \\u2013 and when his mother dies \\u2013 he starts to doubt the portrait of his father\\u2019s character she painted for him when he was a child. This is the cue for a second journey around Europe in search of his father, from Edinburgh to Switzerland, towards a conclusion of great emotional force. A melancholy tale of deception, Until I Find You is also a swaggering comic novel, a giant tapestry of life\\u2019s hopes. It is a masterpiece to compare with John Irving\\u2019s great novels, and restates the author\\u2019s claim to be considered the most glorious, comic, moving novelist at work today.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 106,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1PPaeSTnb8wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 837,\n      \"pub_year\": 2006,\n      \"title\": \"Until I Find You\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 25,\n        \"name\": \"Larry McMurtry\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Pulitzer prize-winning author Larry McMurtry returns to the territory of his masterwork, Lonesome Dove, to sing the song of Calamity Jane's last ride.

If San Francisco has captured the world's imagination through the hardboiled stories of Dashiell Hammett, the prose and poetry of Jack Kerouac and his fellow Beats, through Orson Welles' Lady From Shanghai and Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, it is as a romantic city of vast suspension bridges and foggy back alleys, not as the wild west of Jack London's day. Pre-quake San Francisco was a tough town, and Jack London - hobo, sailor, oyster pirate, hard drinker - was pretty tough, too. Although famous for his stories of the Klondike and the Pacific, London wrote extensively about his home base. This collection contains such classic stories as 'The Apostate' and 'South of the Slot' as well as extracts from John Barleycorn and The Sea-Wolf. The overlooked 1905 story cycle Tales of the Fish Patrol is included in its entirety. London's vivid eyewitness report of the Great 1906 Earthquake and Fire - which destroyed forever the old city - stands as a fitting epilogue. Discover a vanished San Francisco in these wonderful stories of Jack London. Selected as one of the 16 BOOKS TO READ IF YOU LOVE SAN FRANCISCO: \\\"Most of us know San Francisco as a soft foggy charmfest of a city. But it wasn't always so tame. Jack London's San Francisco Stories chronicles the tougher annals of SF's pre-earthquake days, and includes Jack London's firsthand account of the city burning in the wake of the 1906 quake. Either a must-read or must-avoid for anyone waiting for the next shaker. In this collection, you can find the San Francisco that is no longer, but still haunts the back allies.

Set in San Francisco, this is the story of Martin Eden, an impoverished seaman who pursues, obsessively and aggressively, dreams of education and literary fame. London, dissatisfied with the rewards of his own success, intended Martin Eden as an attack on individualism and a criticism of ambition; however, much of its status as a classic has been conferred by admirers of its ambitious protagonist. Andrew Sinclair's wide-ranging introduction discusses the conflict between London's support of socialism and his powerful self-will. Sinclair also explores the parallels and divergences between the life of Martin Eden and that of his creator, focusing on London's mental depressions and how they affected his depiction of Eden.

Like his bestsellers Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo, Comanche Moon, and Dead Man's Walk, Boone's Lick transports the reader to the era about which McMurtry writes better and more shrewdly than anyone else. Told with McMurtry's unique blend of historical fact and sheer storytelling genius, the novel follows the Cecil family's arduous journey by riverboat and wagon from Boone's Lick, Missouri, to Fort Phil Kearny in Wyoming. Fifteen-year-old Shay narrates, describing the journey that begins when his Ma, Mary Margaret, decides to hunt down her elusive husband, Dick, to tell him she's leaving him. Without knowing precisely where he is, they set out across the plains in search of him, encountering grizzly bears, stormy weather, and hostile Indians as they go. With them are Shay's siblings, G.T., Neva, and baby Marcy; Shay's uncle, Seth; his Granpa Crackenthorpe; and Mary Margaret's beautiful half-sister, Rose. During their journey they pick up a barefooted priest named Father Villy, and a Snake Indian named Charlie Seven Days, and persuade them to join in their travels. At the heart of the novel, and the adventure, is Mary Margaret, whom we first meet shooting a sheriff's horse out from underneath him in order to feed her family. Forceful, interesting, and determined, she is written with McMurtry's trademark deftness and sympathy for women, and is in every way a match for the worst the west can muster. Boone's Lick abounds with the incidents, the excitements, and the dangers of life on the plains. Its huge cast of characters includes such historical figures as Wild Bill Hickok and the unfortunate Colonel Fetterman (whose arrogance and ineptitude led to one of the U.S. Army's worst and bloodiest defeats at the hands of the Cheyenne and Sioux) as well as the Cecil family (itself based on a real family of nineteenth-century traders and haulers). The story of their trek in pursuit of Dick, and the discovery of his second and third families, is told with brilliance, humor, and overwhelming joie de vivre in a novel that is at once high adventure, a perfect western tale, and a moving love story -- it is, in short, vintage McMurtry, combining his brilliant character portraits, his unerring sense of the west, and his unrivaled eye for the telling detail. Boone's Lick is one of McMurtry's richest works of fiction to date.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 114,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ylvk8XFq6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 288,\n      \"pub_year\": 2010,\n      \"title\": \"Boone's Lick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 25,\n        \"name\": \"Larry McMurtry\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Ranging from Texas to California on a young writer's journey in a car he calls El Chevy, All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers is one of Larry McMurtry's most vital and entertaining novels.

Nineteen years ago, Dave Cullen was among the first to arrive at Columbine High, even before most of the SWAT teams went in. While writing his acclaimed account of the tragedy, he suffered two bouts of secondary PTSD. He covered all the later tragedies from a distance, working with a cadre of experts cultivated from academia and the FBI, but swore he would never return to the scene of a ghastly crime. But in March 2018, Cullen went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School because something radically different was happening. In nearly twenty years witnessing the mass shootings epidemic escalate, he was stunned and awed by the courage, anger, and conviction of the high school's students. Refusing to allow adults and the media to shape their story, these remarkable adolescents took control, using their grief as a catalyst for change, transforming tragedy into a movement of astonishing hope that has galvanized a nation. Cullen unfolds the story of Parkland through the voices of key participants whose diverse personalities and outlooks comprise every facet of the movement. Instead of taking us into the minds of the killer, he takes us into the hearts of the Douglas students as they cope with the common concerns of high school students everywhere--awaiting college acceptance letters, studying for mid-term exams, competing against their athletic rivals, putting together the yearbook, staging the musical Spring Awakening, enjoying prom and graduation--while moving forward from a horrific event that has altered them forever. Deeply researched and beautifully told, Parkland is an in-depth examination of this pivotal moment in American culture--and an up-close portrait that reveals what these extraordinary young people are like as kids. As it celebrates the passion of these astonishing students who are making history, this spellbinding book is an inspiring call to action for lasting change.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Education\",\n      \"id\": 131,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=yi93xQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 400,\n      \"pub_year\": 2020,\n      \"title\": \"Parkland\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 30,\n        \"name\": \"Raymond Chandler\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Farewell, My Lovely is a classic novel by Raymond Chandler, the master of hard-boiled crime.

Powerfully entwining these characters\\u2019 stories, Light in August brings to life Faulkner\\u2019s imaginary South, one of literature\\u2019s great invented landscapes, in all of its unerringly fascinating glory. Along with a new Foreword by C. E.

He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was established by his father William. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and in his later years contributed generously to it. He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society, but was expelled for misbehavior. Before embarking on his career as a writer he served in the U.S. Navy as a Midshipman which greatly influenced many of his novels and other writings. He is best remembered as a novelist who wrote numerous sea-stories and the historical novels known as the Leatherstocking Tales. Among naval historians Cooper's works on the early U.S. Navy have been well received, but they were sometimes criticized by his contemporaries. Among his most famous works is the Romantic novel The Last of the Mohicans, often regarded as his masterpiece.

Collected here in a single Library of America volume, they are among his finest works. Bold, vigorous, original, each is a tale of high adventure that vividly captures the majesty and power of the seafaring life. Cooper drew on his direct knowledge of ships and sailors to present a truer picture of life on the sea than had ever before achieved in literature. As a boy of seventeen he had sailed before the mast on a merchantman bound from New York to London and then to Spain. On board he experienced the life of a common seaman, learned the craft of sailing, encountered terrifying storms, was chased by pirates, and watched the impressment of crew members by a British man-of-war. He later served as an officer in the United States Navy. The Pilot is loosely based upon stories of John Paul Jones\\u2019s daring hit-and-run tactics during the Revolutionary War. The shadowy hero, modeled on Jones, leads a squadron of the infant American navy in a series of raids on the English coast, braving fierce storms and the guns of hostile warships, yet never revealing his identity. In this novel Cooper introduced the character of the \\u201cold salt,\\u201d the seasoned deckhand happy only aboard ship. Long Tom Coffin, with his briny conversation and shrewd nautical advice, is the first of Cooper\\u2019s memorable portraits of common seaman. A ghostly ship, an uncanny hero, a heroine kidnapped by pirates, revelations of mistaken identity, and the reunion of long-lost relatives\\u2014scenes of romance and adventure fill the pages of The Red Rover, Cooper\\u2019s most theatrical novel. Set in the mid-eighteenth century, the tale recounts the exploits of a noble outcast and visionary who foresees America\\u2019s destiny as a sovereign nation. Forced into a life of piracy, the Rover conducts his private war of independence in a story that equates the free and daring life with the American dream of self-reliance and liberty from British rule.

This collection of more than a dozen pieces showcases the young Capote developing the unique voice and sensibility that would make him one of the twentieth century\\u2019s most original writers.

Capote was always drawn to outsiders\\u2014women, children, African Americans, the poor\\u2014because he felt like one himself from a very early age. Here we see Capote\\u2019s powers of empathy developing as he depicts his characters struggling at the margins of their known worlds. A boy experiences the violence of adulthood when he pursues an escaped convict into the woods.

In a time of extraordinary loss, a woman fights to save the life of a child who has her lover\\u2019s eyes. In these stories we see early signs of Capote\\u2019s genius for creating unforgettable characters built of complexity and yearning. Young women experience the joys and pains of new love. Urbane sophisticates are worn down by cynicism. Children and adults alike seek understanding in a treacherous world. There are tales of crime and violence; of racism and injustice; of poverty and despair. And there are tales of generosity and tenderness; compassion and connection; wit and wonder. Above all there is the developing voice of a writer born in the Deep South who will use and eventually break from that tradition to become a literary figure like no other. With a foreword by the celebrated New Yorker critic Hilton Als, this volume of early stories is essential for understanding how a boy from Monroeville, Alabama, became a legend in American literature.

Hugh Holman Award A central figure in twentieth-century American literature, Robert Penn Warren (1905\\u20131989) was appointed by the Library of Congress as the first Poet Laureate of the United States in 1985. Although better known for his fiction, especially his novel All the King\\u2019s Men, it is mainly his poetry\\u2014spanning sixty years, fifteen volumes of verse, and a wide range of styles\\u2014that reveals Warren to be one of America\\u2019s foremost men of letters. In this indispensable volume, John Burt, Warren\\u2019s literary executor, has assembled every poem Warren ever published (with the exception of Brother to Dragons), including the many poems he published in The Fugitive and other magazines, as well as those that appeared in his small press works and broadsides. Burt has also exhaustively collated all of the published versions of Warren\\u2019s poems\\u2014which, in some cases, appeared as many as six different times with substantive revisions in every line\\u2014as well as his typescripts and proofs. And since Warren never seemed to reread any of his books without a pencil in his hand, Burt has referred to Warren\\u2019s personal library copies. This comprehensive edition also contains textual notes, lists of emendations, and explanatory notes. Warren was born and raised in Guthrie, Kentucky, where southern agrarian values and a predilection for storytelling were ingrained in him as a young boy. By 1925, when he graduated from Vanderbilt University, he was already the most promising of that exceptional set of poets and intellectuals known as the Fugitives. Warren devoted most of the 1940s and 1950s to writing prose and literary criticism, but from the late 1950s he composed primarily poetry, with each successive volume of verse that he penned demonstrating his rigorous and growing commitment to that genre. The mature visionary power and technical virtuosity of his work in the 1970s and early 1980s emanated from his strongly held belief that \\u201conly insofar as the work [of art] establishes and expresses a self can it engage us.\\u201d Many of Warren\\u2019s later poems, which he deemed \\u201csome of my best,\\u201d rejoice in the possibilities of old age and the poet\\u2019s ability for \\u201ccontinually expanding in a vital process of definition, affirmation, revision, and growth, a process that is the image, we may say, of the life process.\\u201d\",\n      \"genre\": \"Poetry\",\n      \"id\": 192,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=tBMN6gmiA6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 866,\n      \"pub_year\": 1998,\n      \"title\": \"The Collected Poems of Robert Penn Warren\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 43,\n        \"name\": \"Robert Penn Warren\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Selected Letters of Robert Penn Warren, Volume three, provides an indispensable glimpse of Warren the writer and the man, covering a crucial decade in his life. Edited by Randy Hendricks and James A. Perkins, and introduced by William Bedford Clark, this collection of largely previously unpublished letters and newly discovered material documents Warren's time at the University of Minnesota, his writing and publication of the Pulitzer Prize\\u2013winning novel All the King's Men, his appointment as Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress, and his divorce from Emma \\u201cCinina\\u201d Brescia and subsequent marriage to the writer Eleanor Clark. The period 1943\\u20131952 also saw the publication of \\u201cA Poem of Pure Imagination\\u201d; World Enough and Time; The Ballad of Billie Potts; At Heaven's Gate; and Selected Poems, 1923\\u20131943. Warren's letters shed new light on those works and on his close relationship with his editors Lambert Davis and Albert Erskine. Included too is correspondence concerning Warren's collaboration with Robert Rossen on the movie production of All the King's Men, which received the Academy Award for best picture in 1949. The list of friends and colleagues with whom Warren communicated reads like a roll call of major twentieth-century literary figures and clearly shows his ever-widening influence on the world of letters. Spanning a remarkable range in both style and tone, the letters disclose Warren's attitudes toward his work as a teacher and his thoughts on the events of World War II, the Korean War, and the political conflicts in postwar Europe. Thoroughly annotated and scrupulously researched, Volume Three captures Warren in an extraordinary phase in his life and career, reaching his maturity and making many commitments at once yet pursuing them all with a seemingly boundless energy.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Reference\",\n      \"id\": 193,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=e_NNP6OM97QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 528,\n      \"pub_year\": 2006,\n      \"title\": \"Selected Letters of Robert Penn Warren\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 43,\n        \"name\": \"Robert Penn Warren\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"In his sixth novel, The Cave (1959), Robert Penn Warren tells the story of a young man trapped in a cave in fictional Johntown, Tennessee.

His novels often featured main characters who succeeded at their objectives despite a lack of a firm moral code, and literary situations that more closely resemble studies of nature than tales of choice and agency. Dreiser's best known novels include Sister Carrie (1900) and An American Tragedy (1925). In 1930 he was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Literature. Early life Dreiser was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Sarah Maria (nee Schanab) and John Paul Dreiser. John Dreiser was a German immigrant from Mayen in the Eifel region, and Sarah was from the Mennonite farming community near Dayton, Ohio. Her family disowned her for converting to Roman Catholicism in order to marry John Dreiser. Theodore was the twelfth of thirteen children (the ninth of the ten surviving). Paul Dresser (1857-1906) was one of his older brothers; Paul changed the spelling of his name as he became a popular songwriter. They were reared as Catholics. After graduating from high school in Warsaw, Indiana, Dreiser attended Indiana University in the years 1889-1890 before dropping out. Writing career Within several years, Dreiser was writing as a journalist for the Chicago Globe newspaper and then the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He wrote several articles on writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Dean Howells, Israel Zangwill, John Burroughs, and interviewed public figures such as Andrew Carnegie, Marshall Field, Thomas Edison, and Theodore Thomas. Other interviewees included Lillian Nordica, Emilia E. Barr, Philip Armour and Alfred Stieglitz. During 1899, the Dreisers stayed with Arthur Henry and his wife, Maude Wood Henry, at the House of Four Pillars, an 1830s Greek Revival house in the Toledo, Ohio suburb of Maumee. There Dreiser began work on his first novel, Sister Carrie, published in 1900. Unknown to Maude, Henry sold a half-interest in the house to Dreiser, to finance a move to New York without her. In Sister Carrie, Dreiser portrayed a changing society, writing about a young woman who flees rural life for the city (Chicago) and struggles with poverty, complex relationships with men, and prostitution. It sold poorly and was considered controversial because of moral objections to his featuring a country girl who pursues her dreams of fame and fortune through relationships with men. The book has since acquired a considerable reputation. It has been called the \\\"greatest of all American urban novels.\\\" It was adapted as a 1952 film by the same name, directed by William Wyler and starring Laurence Olivier and Jennifer Jones. In response to witnessing a lynching in 1893, Dreiser wrote the short story, \\\"Nigger Jeff\\\" (1901), which was published in Ainslee's Magazine.This period is considered the \\\"nadir\\\" of American race relations, with a high rate of lynchings in Southern states, which from 1890 to 1910 also disfranchised most black citizens from voting, legally-enforced white supremacy and Jim Crow, and suppressed black people in second-class status for decades. His second novel, Jennie Gerhardt, was published in 1911.:44 His featuring young woman as protagonists dramatized the social changes of urbanization, as young people moved from rural villages to cities. Dreiser's first commercial success was An American Tragedy, published in 1925. From 1892, when Dreiser began work as a newspaperman, he had begun \\\"to observe a certain type of crime in the United States that proved very common. It seemed to spring from the fact that almost every young person was possessed of an ingrown ambition to be somebody financially and socially.\\\" \\\"Fortune hunting became a disease\\\" with the frequent result of a peculiarly American kind of crime, a form of \\\"murder for money,\\\" when \\\"the young ambitious lover of some poorer girl\\\" found \\\"a more attractive girl with money or position..\\\"..\",\n      \"genre\": null,\n      \"id\": 207,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZCgotAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 72,\n      \"pub_year\": 2017,\n      \"title\": \"The Hand of the Potter : a Tragedy in Four Acts(1918).

This is why she agrees when her new husband, a doctor named Will, asks if they can move to his small hometown. However, soon after Will and Carol arrive in the rural town, Carol finds herself immensely disappointed in the scenery and culture. The architecture of the town is ugly and bland, and is decorated to match. Meanwhile, its occupants hold a high level of snooty conservatism, and immediately disapprove of Carol for being a working woman. Because Carol loves her husband and loves to help, she becomes determined to lead a reform for the town by cleaning up the streets and educating the people. However, as Carol attempts to start progressive clubs and tries to make friends, every idea she has is disregarded and disrespected by the town\\u2019s prominent cliques.

The latter novel zeroed in on the town of Gopher Prairie; the former stopped there briefly and then took the reader by automobile in search of America. Free Air heads toward a West that was brimming with possibilities for suddenly mobile Americans at the end of a world war. The vehicle in Lewis\\u2019s novel, not a Model T but a Gomez-Dep roadster, takes Claire Boltwood and her father from Minnesota to Seattle, exposing them all to the perils of early motoring. On the road, the upper-crust Boltwoods are at once more insignificant and more noble. The greatest distance to be overcome is the social one between Claire and a young mechanic named Milt, who, with a cat as his traveling companion, follows close behind. If Free Air anticipates many of the themes of Lewis\\u2019s later novels, it also looks forward to a genre that includes John Steinbeck\\u2019s Travels with Charley and Josh Greenfeld and Paul Mazursky\\u2019s Harry and Tonto. And the character of Claire, blazing her own trail across the West, looks back to the nineteenth-century pioneer woman and ahead to the independent-minded movie heroines played by Katherine Hepburn.

With the explosion of knowledge taking place in recent decades, scientists are constantly discovering that things they have been certain about are wrong: the continents they thought had been in place forever actually drift around; the cells we are made of are not simple but infinitely complex; our genus has been on Earth many times longer than they thought. And increasingly there is compelling evidence that scientists are wrong about our living relatives. One thing considered certain was that the giants and wildmen in stories from all over the world are entirely imaginary. Now that belief is under serious challenge. Forty-five years ago giant footprints found in northern California brought Bigfoot to the attention of Americans and revived interest in Canada's Sasquatch. Every year since then additional evidence has accumulated, and now that witnesses can submit information via the internet the trickle of reports has become a flood. John Green has been in the thick of things from the beginning. In Sasquatch, The Apes Among Us, first published in 1978, he sampled the evidence from the earliest records up the late 1970s and from all around the world, then concentrated on two aspects of the subject: the nature of the animal described and the wealth of reports from parts of North America outside the Pacific Northwest. When it came out The Apes Among Us was acclaimed as the definitive work on the fascinating subject of whether humans share North America with a giant bipedal primate that is unknown to science. Since then evidence for the existence of that unknown primate has grown exponentially, and individual scientists have written books about aspects of it. Remarkably, however, to most of the scientific world the evidence remains unknown and unexplored, and for those who do follow the subject this is still the definitive book.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n      \"id\": 232,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Te3WAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 500,\n      \"pub_year\": 2017,\n      \"title\": \"Sasquatch\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 53,\n        \"name\": \"Alice Sebold\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"An acclaimed journalist shares the gripping story of her rape when she was a college freshman, achieving justice in the courtroom, and triumphing in the face of violence.\",\n      \"genre\": \"Biography & Autobiography\",\n      \"id\": 233,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=iWi9DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n      \"page_count\": 288,\n      \"pub_year\": 2017,\n      \"title\": \"Lucky\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"id\": 53,\n        \"name\": \"Alice Sebold\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"The spirit of fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon describes her murder, her surprise at her new home in heaven, and her witness to her family's grief, efforts to find the killer, and attempts to come to terms with what has happened.

But Fletcher goes to school up North, and one or two of his Princeton classmates talk about how wrong slavery is until Fletcher begins to think for himself --and he becomes a traitor to his background, to his family, by conspiring to aid in a mass escape of slaves on the Underground Railroad.

But a century after her death, The Awakening is widely regarded as Kate Chopin's great achievement and a celebrated work of early feminist literature. Through careful, subtle changes of style, Chopin shows the transformation of Edna Pontellier, a young wife and mother, who - with tragic consequences - refuses to be caged by married and domestic life, and claims for herself moral and erotic freedom.

Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary qualities. Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work \\\"quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H.

Through quick sketches and vignettes, Bellow evokes places, ideas, and people, reaching a sharp picture of contemporary Israel. The reader is offered a wonderful panorama of an ancient and modern world city.

Bellow delights in the liveliness, the gallantry of Israeli life: people on the edge of history, an inch from disaster, yet brimming with argument and words. He delights not in tourist delusions but with a tough critical spirit: his Israel is pocked with scars and creases, and all the more attractive for it. Simply as a travel book, the reader finds remarkable descriptions, such as one in which Bellow finds \\\"the melting air\\\" of Jerusalem pressing upon him \\\"with an almost human weight\\\" Something intelligible is communicated by the earthlike colors of this most beautiful of cities. The impression that Bellow offers is that living in Israel must be as exhausting as it is exciting: a murderous barrage on the nerves. Israel, he writes, \\\"is both a garrison state and a cultivated society, both Spartan and Athenian. It tries to do everything, to make provisions for everything. All resources, all faculties are strained.

In this landmark volume, America's preeminent storyteller offers us one hundred treasures from alifetime of words and ideas -- tales that amaze, enthrall, and horrify; breathtaking journeys backward and forward in time; classic stories with the undiminished power to tantalize, mystify, elate, and move the reader to tears. Each small gem in the master's collection remains as dazzling as when it first appeared in print. There is magic in these pages: the wonders of interstellar flight, a conspiracy of insects, the early bloom of love in the warmth of August. Both the world of Ray Bradbury and its people are vivid and alive, as colorfully unique as a poker chip hand-painted by a brilliant artist or as warmly familiar as the well-used settings on a family's dining room table. In a poor man's desire for the stars, in the twisted night games of a hateful embalmer, in a magnificent fraud perpetrated to banish despair and repair a future, in a writer's wonderful death is the glowing proof of the timeless artistry of one of America's greatest living bards. The one hundred stories in this volume were chosen by Bradbury himself, and span a career that blossomed in the pulp magazines of the early 1940s and continues to flourish in the new millennium. Here are representatives of the legendary author's finest works of short fiction, including many that have not been republished for decades, all forever fresh and vital, evocative and immensely entertaining.

She penned the 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird that won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and became a classic of modern American literature. Lee received numerous accolades and honorary degrees, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007 which was awarded for her contribution to literature. She assisted her close friend Truman Capote in his research for the book In Cold Blood (1966). Capote was the basis for the character Dill Harris in To Kill a Mockingbird.The plot and characters of To Kill a Mockingbird are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936 when she was 10. The novel deals with the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s, as depicted through the eyes of two children. It was inspired by racist attitudes in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. Go Set a Watchman, written in the mid 1950s, was published in July 2015 as a sequel to Mockingbird but was later confirmed to be an earlier draft of Mockingbird.\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Theatre program.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 1,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=JQGv8eqVMrMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 323,\n          \"pub_year\": 2004,\n          \"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"A beautifully crafted graphic novel adaptation of Harper Lee\\u2019s beloved, Pulitzer prize\\u2013winning American classic. \\\"Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit \\u2018em, but remember it\\u2019s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\\" A haunting portrait of race and class, innocence and injustice, hypocrisy and heroism, tradition and transformation in the Deep South of the 1930s, Harper Lee\\u2019s To Kill a Mockingbird remains as important today as it was upon its initial publication in 1960, during the turbulent years of the Civil Rights movement.

It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, \\\"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\\\" As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage and compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in English-speaking countries with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms. Often the book is challenged for its use of racial epithets, and writers have noticed that regardless of its popularity since its publication, some readers are displeased by the novel's treatment of black characters. Lee's novel was initially reviewed by at least 30 newspapers and magazines, whose critics varied widely in their assessments. More recently, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \\\"every adult should read before they die.\\\" The book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. To date, it is Lee's only published novel, and although she continues to respond to the book's impact, she has refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.\",\n          \"genre\": null,\n          \"id\": 3,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=872PjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 192,\n          \"pub_year\": 2016,\n          \"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Required reading in most high schools, this Pulitzer Prize winning novel was originally published in 1969 and was voted the best book of the century by Library Journal.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 4,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=o7qjPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 312,\n          \"pub_year\": 1991,\n          \"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"From celebrated Pulitzer Prize-winning author Harper Lee, her bestselling novels To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman available together in this convenient e-book bundle.

He is best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age\\u2014a term he  created and popularized in his short story collection Tales of the Jazz Age. During his lifetime, he published four novels, four story collections, and 164 short stories. Although he achieved temporary popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald received critical acclaim only after his death and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\\nBorn into a middle-class family in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Fitzgerald was raised primarily in New York state. He attended Princeton University where he befriended future literary critic Edmund Wilson. Owing to a failed romantic relationship with Chicago socialite Ginevra King, he dropped out in 1917 to join the United States Army during World War I. While stationed in Alabama, he met Zelda Sayre, a Southern debutante who belonged to Montgomery's exclusive country-club set. Although she initially rejected Fitzgerald's marriage proposal due to his lack of financial prospects, Zelda agreed to marry him after he published the commercially successful This Side of Paradise (1920). The novel became a cultural sensation and cemented his reputation as one of the eminent writers of the decade.\\nHis second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922), propelled him further into the cultural elite. To maintain his affluent lifestyle, he wrote numerous stories for popular magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's Weekly, and Esquire. During this period, Fitzgerald frequented Europe, where he befriended modernist writers and artists of the \\\"Lost Generation\\\" expatriate community, including Ernest Hemingway. His third novel, The Great Gatsby (1925), received generally favorable reviews but was a commercial failure, selling fewer than 23,000 copies in its first year. Despite its lackluster debut, The Great Gatsby is now hailed by some literary critics as the \\\"Great American Novel\\\". Following the deterioration of his wife's mental health and her placement in a mental institute for schizophrenia, Fitzgerald completed his final novel, Tender Is the Night (1934).\\nStruggling financially because of the declining popularity of his works amid the Great Depression, Fitzgerald moved to Hollywood where he embarked upon an unsuccessful career as a screenwriter. While living in Hollywood, he cohabited with columnist Sheilah Graham, his final companion before his death. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he attained sobriety only to die of a heart attack in 1940, at 44. His friend Edmund Wilson edited and published an unfinished fifth novel, The Last Tycoon (1941), after Fitzgerald's death. In 1993, a new edition was published as The Love of the Last Tycoon, edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Edited and with an Introduction by Bryant Mangum Foreword by Roxana Robinson Benediction \\u2022 Head and Shoulders \\u2022 Bernice Bobs Her Hair \\u2022 The Ice Palace \\u2022 The Offshore Pirate \\u2022 May Day \\u2022 The Jelly Bean \\u2022 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz \\u2022 Winter Dreams \\u2022 Absolution In the euphoric months before and after the publication of This Side of Paradise, F.

He was praised as the \\\"greatest humorist the United States has produced\\\", and William Faulkner called him \\\"the father of American literature\\\". His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), the latter of which has often been called the \\\"Great American Novel\\\". Twain also wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889) and Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894), and co-wrote The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873) with Charles Dudley Warner.\\nTwain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous story \\\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\\" was published in 1865, based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty. Initially an ardent American imperialist who spoke out strongly in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands, he later became vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League from 1901 until his death in 1910, coming out strongly against the Philippine-American War.Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures but invested in ventures that lost most of it\\u2014such as the Paige Compositor, a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision. He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, but in time overcame his financial troubles with the help of Standard Oil executive Henry Huttleston Rogers. He eventually paid all his creditors in full, even though his bankruptcy relieved him of having to do so. \\nTwain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley's Comet, and he predicted that he would \\\"go out with it\\\" as well, dying the day after the comet made its closest approach to Earth.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"This historical novel purportedly written by Joan's longtime friend -- Sieur Louis de Conte -- discloses Twain's unrestrained admiration for the French heroine's nobility of character.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Biography & Autobiography\",\n          \"id\": 9,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=RCr_SE1DNoUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 598,\n          \"pub_year\": 1989,\n          \"title\": \"Joan of Arc\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"One of America's foremost authors and humorists relates experiences lived, people encountered, places visited, and judgments rendered throughout his lifetime.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Biography & Autobiography\",\n          \"id\": 10,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=WQYfA3qf7dUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 454,\n          \"pub_year\": 2012,\n          \"title\": \"Autobiography of Mark Twain\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"These sixty satirical, rollicking, uproarious tales by the greatest yarn-spinner in our literary history are as fresh and vivid as ever more than a century after their author\\u2019s death.

His works often focus on history, morality, and religion.\\nHe was born in 1804 in Salem, Massachusetts, from a family long associated with that town. Hawthorne entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. He published his first work in 1828, the novel Fanshawe; he later tried to suppress it, feeling that it was not equal to the standard of his later work. He published several short stories in periodicals, which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The following year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at the Boston Custom House and joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment as consul took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to Concord in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864.\\nMuch of Hawthorne's writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral metaphors with an anti-Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories, and a biography of his college friend Franklin Pierce, written for his 1852 campaign for President of the United States, which Pierce won, becoming the 14th president.\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Twenty-four of the best short stories by one of the early masters of the form, in the definitive collection edited by acclaimed scholar Newton Arvin.

The novel tells of archetypal Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara as she grows from a young woman into maturity against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Like many of the early 20th century Southern writers, Mitchell portrays an idyllic image of the antebellum South.

In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin--that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own. On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 28,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=DMFcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": null,\n          \"pub_year\": 2016,\n          \"title\": \"Gone With The Wind\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"description\": \"American author and journalist (1900\\u20131949)\",\n      \"id\": 6,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Margaret_Mitchell_NYWTS.jpg\",\n      \"name\": \"Margaret Mitchell\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"bio\": \"Louisa May Alcott (; November 29, 1832 \\u2013 March 6, 1888) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet best known as the author of the novel Little Women (1868) and its sequels Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886).

It all began one typical day in the life of Joe Heller. He was jogging four miles at a clip these days, working on his novel God Knows, coping with the complications of an unpleasant divorce, and pigging out once or twice a week on Chinese food with cronies like Mel Brooks, Mario Puzo, and his buddy of more than twenty years, Speed Vogel. He was feeling perfectly fine that day\\u2014but within twenty-four hours he would be in intensive care at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital. He would remain hospitalized for nearly six months and leave in a wheelchair. Joseph Heller had Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome, a debilitating, sometimes fatal condition that can leave its victims paralyzed from head to toe. The clan gathered immediately. Speed\\u2014sometime artist, sometime businessman, sometime herring taster, and now a coauthor\\u2014moved into Joe's apartment as messenger, servant, and shaman. Mel Brooks, arch-hypochondriac of the Western world, knew as much about Heller's condition as the doctors. Mario Puzo, author of the preeminent gangster novel of our time, proved to be the most reluctant man ever to be dragged along on a hospital visit. These and lots of others rallied around the sickbed in a show of loyalty and friendship that not only built a wild and spirited camaraderie but helped bring Joe Heller, writer and buddy extraordinaire, through his greatest crisis. This book is an inspiring, hilarious memoir of a calamitous illness and the rocky road to recuperation\\u2014as only the author of Catch-22 and the friend who helped him back to health could tell it.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \\\"witch-hunts\\\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing: \\\"Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\\\" For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's home in Amherst.\\nEvidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.While Dickinson was a prolific writer, her only publications during her lifetime were 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems, and one letter. The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique for her era; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends, and also explore aesthetics, society, nature, and spirituality.Although Dickinson's acquaintances were most likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\\u2014that her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955. In 1998, The New York Times reported on an infrared technology study revealing that much of Dickinson's work had been deliberately censored to exclude the name \\\"Susan\\\". At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to her sister-in-law Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson, though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd. These edits work to censor the nature of Emily and Susan's relationship, which many scholars have interpreted as romantic.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"An illustrated introduction to the poetry of Emily Dickinson.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Juvenile Nonfiction\",\n          \"id\": 57,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=4hezDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 57,\n          \"pub_year\": 2016,\n          \"title\": \"Poetry for Kids: Emily Dickinson\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Share in Dickinson\\u2019s admiration of language, nature, and life and death, with The Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Literary Criticism\",\n          \"id\": 58,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=uaxVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 243,\n          \"pub_year\": 2022,\n          \"title\": \"The Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Edited by the nation's foremost authority on the poet's manuscripts, a three-volume edition presents 1,789 chronologically arranged poems--the largest number ever assembled--drawn from archives and lost manuscripts, accompanied by tables and an introduction.

A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work was controversial in his time, particularly his 1855 poetry collection Leaves of Grass, which was described as obscene for its overt sensuality. \\nBorn in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman resided in Brooklyn as a child and through much of his career. At the age of 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. Later, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, and a government clerk.  Whitman's major poetry collection, Leaves of Grass, was first published in 1855 with his own money and became well known. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. During the American Civil War, he went to Washington, D.C. and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded. His poetry often focused on both loss and healing. On the death of Abraham Lincoln, whom Whitman greatly admired, he wrote his well known poems, \\\"O Captain! My Captain!\\\" and \\\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\\", and gave a series of lectures. After a stroke towards the end of his life, Whitman moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at the age of 72, his funeral was a public event.Whitman's influence on poetry remains strong. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe argued: \\\"You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass ... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him.\\\" Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman \\\"America's poet ...

To give a new voice to the new nation shaken by civil war, he spent his entire life revising and adding to the work, but his initial act of bravado in answering Ralph Waldo Emerson's call for a national poet has made Whitman the quintessential American writer. This rich cross-section of his work includes poems from throughout Whitman's lifetime as published on his deathbed edition of 1891, short stories, his prefaces to the many editions of Leaves of Grass, and a variety of prose selections, including Democratic Vistas, Specimen Days, and Slang in America.

Dreiser's best known novels include Sister Carrie (1900) and An American Tragedy (1925). In 1930 he was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Literature. Early life Dreiser was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Sarah Maria (nee Schanab) and John Paul Dreiser. John Dreiser was a German immigrant from Mayen in the Eifel region, and Sarah was from the Mennonite farming community near Dayton, Ohio. Her family disowned her for converting to Roman Catholicism in order to marry John Dreiser. Theodore was the twelfth of thirteen children (the ninth of the ten surviving). Paul Dresser (1857-1906) was one of his older brothers; Paul changed the spelling of his name as he became a popular songwriter. They were reared as Catholics. After graduating from high school in Warsaw, Indiana, Dreiser attended Indiana University in the years 1889-1890 before dropping out. Writing career Within several years, Dreiser was writing as a journalist for the Chicago Globe newspaper and then the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He wrote several articles on writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Dean Howells, Israel Zangwill, John Burroughs, and interviewed public figures such as Andrew Carnegie, Marshall Field, Thomas Edison, and Theodore Thomas. Other interviewees included Lillian Nordica, Emilia E. Barr, Philip Armour and Alfred Stieglitz. During 1899, the Dreisers stayed with Arthur Henry and his wife, Maude Wood Henry, at the House of Four Pillars, an 1830s Greek Revival house in the Toledo, Ohio suburb of Maumee. There Dreiser began work on his first novel, Sister Carrie, published in 1900. Unknown to Maude, Henry sold a half-interest in the house to Dreiser, to finance a move to New York without her. In Sister Carrie, Dreiser portrayed a changing society, writing about a young woman who flees rural life for the city (Chicago) and struggles with poverty, complex relationships with men, and prostitution. It sold poorly and was considered controversial because of moral objections to his featuring a country girl who pursues her dreams of fame and fortune through relationships with men. The book has since acquired a considerable reputation. It has been called the \\\"greatest of all American urban novels.\\\" It was adapted as a 1952 film by the same name, directed by William Wyler and starring Laurence Olivier and Jennifer Jones. In response to witnessing a lynching in 1893, Dreiser wrote the short story, \\\"Nigger Jeff\\\" (1901), which was published in Ainslee's Magazine.This period is considered the \\\"nadir\\\" of American race relations, with a high rate of lynchings in Southern states, which from 1890 to 1910 also disfranchised most black citizens from voting, legally-enforced white supremacy and Jim Crow, and suppressed black people in second-class status for decades. His second novel, Jennie Gerhardt, was published in 1911.:44 His featuring young woman as protagonists dramatized the social changes of urbanization, as young people moved from rural villages to cities. Dreiser's first commercial success was An American Tragedy, published in 1925. From 1892, when Dreiser began work as a newspaperman, he had begun \\\"to observe a certain type of crime in the United States that proved very common. It seemed to spring from the fact that almost every young person was possessed of an ingrown ambition to be somebody financially and socially.\\\" \\\"Fortune hunting became a disease\\\" with the frequent result of a peculiarly American kind of crime, a form of \\\"murder for money,\\\" when \\\"the young ambitious lover of some poorer girl\\\" found \\\"a more attractive girl with money or position..\\\"..\",\n          \"genre\": null,\n          \"id\": 207,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZCgotAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 72,\n          \"pub_year\": 2017,\n          \"title\": \"The Hand of the Potter : a Tragedy in Four Acts(1918).

They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first Oz book in 1900.  While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a film studio focused on children's films in Los Angeles, California.\\nHis works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of clothes advertising (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"\\\"Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.

He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s.\\nKesey was born in La Junta, Colorado, and grew up in Springfield, Oregon, graduating from the University of Oregon in 1957. He began writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1960 after completing a graduate fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later. During this period, Kesey participated in government studies involving hallucinogenic drugs (including mescaline and LSD) to supplement his income.After One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was published, Kesey moved to nearby La Honda, California, and began hosting happenings with former colleagues from Stanford, miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures (most notably Neal Cassady) and other friends collectively known as the Merry Pranksters; these parties, known as Acid Tests, integrated the consumption of LSD with multimedia performances. He mentored the Grateful Dead (the Acid Tests' de facto house band) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their career.\\nKesey's second novel, Sometimes a Great Notion\\u2014an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the modernist grandeur of William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha saga\\u2014was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964. Kesey regarded it as his magnum opus.In 1965, after an arrest for marijuana possession and faking suicide, Kesey was imprisoned for five months. Shortly thereafter, he returned home to the Willamette Valley and settled in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, where he maintained a secluded, family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life. In addition to teaching at the University of Oregon\\u2014an experience that culminated in Caverns (1989), a collaborative novel by Kesey and his graduate workshop students under the pseudonym \\\"O.U. Levon\\\"\\u2014he continued to regularly contribute fiction and reportage to such publications as Esquire, Rolling Stone, Oui, Running, and The Whole Earth Catalog; various iterations of these pieces were collected in Kesey's Garage Sale (1973) and Demon Box (1986).\\nBetween 1974 and 1980, Kesey published six issues of Spit in the Ocean, a literary magazine that featured excerpts from an unfinished novel (Seven Prayers by Grandma Whittier, an account of Kesey's grandmother's struggle with Alzheimer's disease) and contributions from writers including Margo St. James, Kate Millett, Stewart Brand, Saul-Paul Sirag, Jack Sarfatti, Paul Krassner and William S.

Women saw him and wanted to weep\\\"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the \\\"place over there\\\" to claim retribution for what she lost and for what was taken from her. Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance.

She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.\\nShe became a poet and writer after a string of odd jobs during her young adulthood. These included fry cook, sex worker, nightclub performer, Porgy and Bess cast member, Southern Christian Leadership Conference coordinator, and correspondent in Egypt and Ghana during the decolonization of Africa. She was also an actress, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. In 1982, she was named the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s, she made approximately 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \\\"On the Pulse of Morning\\\" (1993) at the first inauguration of Bill Clinton, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961.\\nWith the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for Black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes including racism, identity, family and travel.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"The best selling author presents a new collection of poems.

She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. Their relationship was tumultuous and, in her letters, Plath alleges abuse at his hands.

Although several people in the literary world felt his writing skills were praiseworthy, Toole's novels were rejected during his lifetime. Due in part to these failures, he suffered from paranoia and depression, dying by suicide at the age of 31.\\nToole was born to a middle-class family in New Orleans. From a young age, his mother, Thelma, taught him an appreciation of culture. She was thoroughly involved in his affairs for most of his life, and at times they had a difficult relationship. With his mother's encouragement, Toole became a stage performer at the age of 10 doing comic impressions and acting. At 16 he wrote his first novel, The Neon Bible, which he later dismissed as \\\"adolescent\\\".Toole received an academic scholarship to Tulane University in New Orleans. After graduating from Tulane, he studied English Literature at Columbia University in New York while teaching simultaneously at Hunter College. He also taught at various Louisiana colleges, and during his early career as an academic he was valued on the faculty party circuit for his wit and gift for mimicry. His studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the army, where he taught English to Spanish-speaking recruits in San Juan, Puerto Rico. After receiving a promotion, he used his private office to begin writing A Confederacy of Dunces, which he finished at his parents' home after his discharge.\\nDunces is a picaresque novel featuring the misadventures of protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a lazy, obese, misanthropic, self-styled scholar who lives at home with his mother. It is hailed for its accurate depictions of New Orleans dialects. Toole based Reilly in part on his college professor friend Bob Byrne. Byrne's slovenly, eccentric behavior was anything but professorial, and Reilly mirrored him in these respects. The character was also based on Toole himself, and several personal experiences served as inspiration for passages in the novel. While at Tulane, Toole filled in for a friend at a job as a hot tamale cart vendor, and worked at a family owned and operated clothing factory. Both of these experiences were later adopted into his fiction.\\nToole submitted Dunces to publisher Simon & Schuster, where it reached editor Robert Gottlieb. Gottlieb considered Toole talented but felt his comic novel was essentially pointless. Despite several revisions, Gottlieb remained unsatisfied, and after the book was rejected by another literary figure, Hodding Carter Jr., Toole shelved the novel. Suffering from depression and feelings of persecution, Toole left home on a journey around the country. He stopped in Biloxi, Mississippi, ending his life by running a garden hose in from the exhaust of his car to the cabin. Some years later, his mother brought the manuscript of Dunces to the attention of novelist Walker Percy, who ushered the book into print. In 1981, Toole was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"?\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 93,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXxWIS_KF5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 368,\n          \"pub_year\": 2000,\n          \"title\": \"A Confederacy of Dunces\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Set in New Orleans, the protagonist is nearly arrested for being a suspicious character and encounters many unfortunate events.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 94,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=arZACPpQop4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 418,\n          \"pub_year\": 1980,\n          \"title\": \"A Confederacy of Dunces\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the bestselling cult classic A Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole, when he was only sixteen, The Neon Bible is a sweet, moving, and memorable coming-of-age story\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 95,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=e0zutAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 176,\n          \"pub_year\": 2019,\n          \"title\": \"The Neon Bible\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"After four decades, the peerless wit and indulgent absurdity of A Confederacy of Dunces continues to attract new readers.

He introduced \\\"plastic theatre\\\" in this play and it closely reflected his own unhappy family background. It was the first of a string of successes, including A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), and The Night of the Iguana (1961). With his later work, Williams attempted a new style that did not appeal as widely to audiences. His drama A Streetcar Named Desire is often numbered on short lists of the finest American plays of the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman.Much of Williams's most acclaimed work has been adapted for the cinema.

Several of his short stories, novels, and plays have been praised as literary classics, including the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958) and the true crime novel In Cold Blood (1966), which he labeled a \\\"non-fiction novel\\\". His works have been adapted into more than 20 films and television dramas.\\nCapote rose above a childhood troubled by divorce, a long absence from his mother, and multiple migrations. He had discovered his calling as a writer by the time he was eight years old, and he honed his writing ability throughout his childhood. He began his professional career writing short stories. The critical success of \\\"Miriam\\\" (1945) attracted the attention of Random House publisher Bennett Cerf and resulted in a contract to write the novel Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948). Capote earned the most fame with In Cold Blood (1966), a journalistic work about the murder of a Kansas farm family in their home. Capote spent six years writing the book, aided by his lifelong friend Harper Lee, who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird (1960).\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"From the Modern Library\\u2019s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by Truman Capote\\u2014also available are Breakfast at Tiffany\\u2019s and Other Voices, Other Rooms (in one volume), In Cold Blood, and Portraits and Observations Most readers know Truman Capote as the author of Breakfast at Tiffany\\u2019s and In Cold Blood, or they remember his notorious social life and wild and witty public appearances.

This collection of more than a dozen pieces showcases the young Capote developing the unique voice and sensibility that would make him one of the twentieth century\\u2019s most original writers. Spare yet heartfelt, these stories summon our compassion and feeling at every turn. Capote was always drawn to outsiders\\u2014women, children, African Americans, the poor\\u2014because he felt like one himself from a very early age. Here we see Capote\\u2019s powers of empathy developing as he depicts his characters struggling at the margins of their known worlds. A boy experiences the violence of adulthood when he pursues an escaped convict into the woods. Petty jealousies lead to a life-altering event for a popular girl at Miss Burke\\u2019s Academy for Young Ladies. In a time of extraordinary loss, a woman fights to save the life of a child who has her lover\\u2019s eyes. In these stories we see early signs of Capote\\u2019s genius for creating unforgettable characters built of complexity and yearning. Young women experience the joys and pains of new love. Urbane sophisticates are worn down by cynicism. Children and adults alike seek understanding in a treacherous world. There are tales of crime and violence; of racism and injustice; of poverty and despair. And there are tales of generosity and tenderness; compassion and connection; wit and wonder. Above all there is the developing voice of a writer born in the Deep South who will use and eventually break from that tradition to become a literary figure like no other. With a foreword by the celebrated New Yorker critic Hilton Als, this volume of early stories is essential for understanding how a boy from Monroeville, Alabama, became a legend in American literature.

He \\\"learned English at age six and spoke with a marked accent into his late teens.\\\" During World War II, he served in the United States Merchant Marine; he completed his first novel at the time, which was published more than 40 years after his death. His first published book was The Town and the City (1950), and he achieved widespread fame and notoriety with his second, On the Road, in 1957. It made him a beat icon, and he went on to publish 12 more novels and numerous poetry volumes.\\nKerouac is recognized for his style of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as his Catholic spirituality, jazz, travel, promiscuity, life in New York City, Buddhism, drugs, and poverty. He became an underground celebrity and, with other Beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements. He has a lasting legacy, greatly influencing many of the cultural icons of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Jerry Garcia and the Doors.\\nIn 1969, at the age of 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking.

From Copenhagen to Amsterdam, William, a brilliant church organist and profligate womanizer, is always a step ahead \\u2013 has always just departed in a wave of scandal, with a new tattoo somewhere on his body from a local master or \\u201cscratcher.\\u201d Alice and Jack abandon their quest, and Jack is educated at schools in Canada and New England \\u2013 including, tellingly, a girls\\u2019 school in Toronto.

Too much happens in this expansive, eventful novel to possibly summarize it all. Emma and Jack move to Los Angeles, where Emma becomes a successful novelist and Jack a promising actor. A host of eccentric minor characters memorably come and go, including Jack\\u2019s hilariously confused teacher the Wurtz; Michelle Maher, the girlfriend he will never forget; and a precocious child Jack finds in the back of an Audi in a restaurant parking lot.

And John Irving renders his protagonist\\u2019s unusual rise through Hollywood with the same vivid detail and range of emotions he gives to the organ music Jack hears as a child in European churches.

This is the cue for a second journey around Europe in search of his father, from Edinburgh to Switzerland, towards a conclusion of great emotional force. A melancholy tale of deception, Until I Find You is also a swaggering comic novel, a giant tapestry of life\\u2019s hopes.

If San Francisco has captured the world's imagination through the hardboiled stories of Dashiell Hammett, the prose and poetry of Jack Kerouac and his fellow Beats, through Orson Welles' Lady From Shanghai and Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, it is as a romantic city of vast suspension bridges and foggy back alleys, not as the wild west of Jack London's day. Pre-quake San Francisco was a tough town, and Jack London - hobo, sailor, oyster pirate, hard drinker - was pretty tough, too. Although famous for his stories of the Klondike and the Pacific, London wrote extensively about his home base. This collection contains such classic stories as 'The Apostate' and 'South of the Slot' as well as extracts from John Barleycorn and The Sea-Wolf. The overlooked 1905 story cycle Tales of the Fish Patrol is included in its entirety. London's vivid eyewitness report of the Great 1906 Earthquake and Fire - which destroyed forever the old city - stands as a fitting epilogue.

Set in San Francisco, this is the story of Martin Eden, an impoverished seaman who pursues, obsessively and aggressively, dreams of education and literary fame. London, dissatisfied with the rewards of his own success, intended Martin Eden as an attack on individualism and a criticism of ambition; however, much of its status as a classic has been conferred by admirers of its ambitious protagonist. Andrew Sinclair's wide-ranging introduction discusses the conflict between London's support of socialism and his powerful self-will. Sinclair also explores the parallels and divergences between the life of Martin Eden and that of his creator, focusing on London's mental depressions and how they affected his depiction of Eden.

Like his bestsellers Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo, Comanche Moon, and Dead Man's Walk, Boone's Lick transports the reader to the era about which McMurtry writes better and more shrewdly than anyone else. Told with McMurtry's unique blend of historical fact and sheer storytelling genius, the novel follows the Cecil family's arduous journey by riverboat and wagon from Boone's Lick, Missouri, to Fort Phil Kearny in Wyoming. Fifteen-year-old Shay narrates, describing the journey that begins when his Ma, Mary Margaret, decides to hunt down her elusive husband, Dick, to tell him she's leaving him. Without knowing precisely where he is, they set out across the plains in search of him, encountering grizzly bears, stormy weather, and hostile Indians as they go. With them are Shay's siblings, G.T., Neva, and baby Marcy; Shay's uncle, Seth; his Granpa Crackenthorpe; and Mary Margaret's beautiful half-sister, Rose. During their journey they pick up a barefooted priest named Father Villy, and a Snake Indian named Charlie Seven Days, and persuade them to join in their travels. At the heart of the novel, and the adventure, is Mary Margaret, whom we first meet shooting a sheriff's horse out from underneath him in order to feed her family. Forceful, interesting, and determined, she is written with McMurtry's trademark deftness and sympathy for women, and is in every way a match for the worst the west can muster. Boone's Lick abounds with the incidents, the excitements, and the dangers of life on the plains. Its huge cast of characters includes such historical figures as Wild Bill Hickok and the unfortunate Colonel Fetterman (whose arrogance and ineptitude led to one of the U.S. Army's worst and bloodiest defeats at the hands of the Cheyenne and Sioux) as well as the Cecil family (itself based on a real family of nineteenth-century traders and haulers). The story of their trek in pursuit of Dick, and the discovery of his second and third families, is told with brilliance, humor, and overwhelming joie de vivre in a novel that is at once high adventure, a perfect western tale, and a moving love story -- it is, in short, vintage McMurtry, combining his brilliant character portraits, his unerring sense of the west, and his unrivaled eye for the telling detail. Boone's Lick is one of McMurtry's richest works of fiction to date.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 114,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ylvk8XFq6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 288,\n          \"pub_year\": 2010,\n          \"title\": \"Boone's Lick\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Ranging from Texas to California on a young writer's journey in a car he calls El Chevy, All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers is one of Larry McMurtry's most vital and entertaining novels.

January 20], 1905 \\u2013 March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name Ayn Rand (), was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, Rand published her best-selling work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.\\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge; she rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism as opposed to altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism, statism, and anarchism. Instead, she supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including private property rights. Although Rand opposed libertarianism, which she viewed as anarchism, she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.\\nRand's books have sold over 37 million copies. Her fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics, with reviews becoming more negative for her later work. Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death, academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor. Her writings have politically influenced some right-libertarians and conservatives. The Objectivist movement circulates her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"A prolific writer, bestselling novelist, and world-renowned philosopher, Ayn Rand defined a full system of thought--from epistemology to aesthetics.

He is known for his graphic depictions of violence and his unique writing style, recognizable by a sparse use of punctuation and attribution. McCarthy is widely regarded as one of the greatest contemporary American writers.McCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, although he was raised primarily in Tennessee. In 1951, he enrolled in the University of Tennessee, but dropped out to join the US Air Force. His debut novel, The Orchard Keeper, was published in 1965. Awarded literary grants, McCarthy was able to travel to southern Europe, where he wrote his second novel, Outer Dark (1968). Suttree (1979), like his other early novels, received generally positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. A MacArthur Fellowship enabled him to travel to the American Southwest, where he researched and wrote his  fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985). Although it garnered a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since been regarded as his magnum opus, with some labeling it the Great American Novel.\\nMcCarthy first experienced widespread success with All the Pretty Horses (1992), for which he received both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was followed by The Crossing (1994) and Cities of the Plain (1998), completing the Border Trilogy. His 2005 novel No Country for Old Men received mixed reviews. His 2006 novel The Road won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction. Many of McCarthy's works have been adapted into film. No Country for Old Men was adapted into a 2007 film, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and Child of God have also been adapted into films, while Outer Dark was turned into a 15-minute short. McCarthy had a play adapted into a 2011 film, The Sunset Limited.\\nMcCarthy works with  the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a multidisciplinary research center. At the SFI, he published the essay \\\"The Kekul\\u00e9 Problem\\\" (2017), which explores the human unconscious and the origin of language. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012. His most recent novels, The Passenger and Stella Maris, were published on October 25, 2022, and December 6, 2022, respectively.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"NATIONAL BESTSELLER \\u2022 WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE \\u2022 A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this \\\"tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master.

Nineteen years ago, Dave Cullen was among the first to arrive at Columbine High, even before most of the SWAT teams went in. While writing his acclaimed account of the tragedy, he suffered two bouts of secondary PTSD. He covered all the later tragedies from a distance, working with a cadre of experts cultivated from academia and the FBI, but swore he would never return to the scene of a ghastly crime. But in March 2018, Cullen went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School because something radically different was happening. In nearly twenty years witnessing the mass shootings epidemic escalate, he was stunned and awed by the courage, anger, and conviction of the high school's students. Refusing to allow adults and the media to shape their story, these remarkable adolescents took control, using their grief as a catalyst for change, transforming tragedy into a movement of astonishing hope that has galvanized a nation. Cullen unfolds the story of Parkland through the voices of key participants whose diverse personalities and outlooks comprise every facet of the movement. Instead of taking us into the minds of the killer, he takes us into the hearts of the Douglas students as they cope with the common concerns of high school students everywhere--awaiting college acceptance letters, studying for mid-term exams, competing against their athletic rivals, putting together the yearbook, staging the musical Spring Awakening, enjoying prom and graduation--while moving forward from a horrific event that has altered them forever. Deeply researched and beautifully told, Parkland is an in-depth examination of this pivotal moment in American culture--and an up-close portrait that reveals what these extraordinary young people are like as kids. As it celebrates the passion of these astonishing students who are making history, this spellbinding book is an inspiring call to action for lasting change.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Education\",\n          \"id\": 131,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=yi93xQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 400,\n          \"pub_year\": 2020,\n          \"title\": \"Parkland\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"description\": \"American author\",\n      \"id\": 29,\n      \"image_url\": null,\n      \"name\": \"Dave Cullen\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"bio\": \"Raymond Thornton Chandler (July 23, 1888 \\u2013 March 26, 1959) was an American-British novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression. His first short story, \\\"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\\\", was published in 1933 in Black Mask, a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but Playback have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.Chandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is a founder of the hardboiled school of detective fiction, along with Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain and other Black Mask writers. The protagonist of his novels, Philip Marlowe, like Hammett's Sam Spade, is considered by some to be synonymous with \\\"private detective\\\". Both were played in films by Humphrey Bogart, whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.\\nAt least three of Chandler's novels have been regarded as masterpieces, including Farewell, My Lovely (1940), The Little Sister (1949), and The Long Goodbye (1953). The Long Goodbye was praised in an anthology of American crime stories as \\\"arguably the first book since Hammett's The Glass Key, published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery\\\".

Collected here in a single Library of America volume, they are among his finest works. Bold, vigorous, original, each is a tale of high adventure that vividly captures the majesty and power of the seafaring life. Cooper drew on his direct knowledge of ships and sailors to present a truer picture of life on the sea than had ever before achieved in literature. As a boy of seventeen he had sailed before the mast on a merchantman bound from New York to London and then to Spain. On board he experienced the life of a common seaman, learned the craft of sailing, encountered terrifying storms, was chased by pirates, and watched the impressment of crew members by a British man-of-war. He later served as an officer in the United States Navy. The Pilot is loosely based upon stories of John Paul Jones\\u2019s daring hit-and-run tactics during the Revolutionary War. The shadowy hero, modeled on Jones, leads a squadron of the infant American navy in a series of raids on the English coast, braving fierce storms and the guns of hostile warships, yet never revealing his identity. In this novel Cooper introduced the character of the \\u201cold salt,\\u201d the seasoned deckhand happy only aboard ship. Long Tom Coffin, with his briny conversation and shrewd nautical advice, is the first of Cooper\\u2019s memorable portraits of common seaman. A ghostly ship, an uncanny hero, a heroine kidnapped by pirates, revelations of mistaken identity, and the reunion of long-lost relatives\\u2014scenes of romance and adventure fill the pages of The Red Rover, Cooper\\u2019s most theatrical novel. Set in the mid-eighteenth century, the tale recounts the exploits of a noble outcast and visionary who foresees America\\u2019s destiny as a sovereign nation. Forced into a life of piracy, the Rover conducts his private war of independence in a story that equates the free and daring life with the American dream of self-reliance and liberty from British rule. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation\\u2019s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America\\u2019s best and most significant writing.

His historical romances of frontier and Indian life in the early American days created a unique form of American literature. Before embarking on his career as a writer, Cooper served in the U.S. Navy, which greatly influenced many of his novels. The novel that launched his career was The Spy, tale of espionage in Revolutionary War. He also wrote numerous sea stories, and his best-known works are five historical novels of the frontier period known as the Leatherstocking Tales.

Although better known for his fiction, especially his novel All the King\\u2019s Men, it is mainly his poetry\\u2014spanning sixty years, fifteen volumes of verse, and a wide range of styles\\u2014that reveals Warren to be one of America\\u2019s foremost men of letters. In this indispensable volume, John Burt, Warren\\u2019s literary executor, has assembled every poem Warren ever published (with the exception of Brother to Dragons), including the many poems he published in The Fugitive and other magazines, as well as those that appeared in his small press works and broadsides. Burt has also exhaustively collated all of the published versions of Warren\\u2019s poems\\u2014which, in some cases, appeared as many as six different times with substantive revisions in every line\\u2014as well as his typescripts and proofs. And since Warren never seemed to reread any of his books without a pencil in his hand, Burt has referred to Warren\\u2019s personal library copies. This comprehensive edition also contains textual notes, lists of emendations, and explanatory notes. Warren was born and raised in Guthrie, Kentucky, where southern agrarian values and a predilection for storytelling were ingrained in him as a young boy. By 1925, when he graduated from Vanderbilt University, he was already the most promising of that exceptional set of poets and intellectuals known as the Fugitives. Warren devoted most of the 1940s and 1950s to writing prose and literary criticism, but from the late 1950s he composed primarily poetry, with each successive volume of verse that he penned demonstrating his rigorous and growing commitment to that genre. The mature visionary power and technical virtuosity of his work in the 1970s and early 1980s emanated from his strongly held belief that \\u201conly insofar as the work [of art] establishes and expresses a self can it engage us.\\u201d Many of Warren\\u2019s later poems, which he deemed \\u201csome of my best,\\u201d rejoice in the possibilities of old age and the poet\\u2019s ability for \\u201ccontinually expanding in a vital process of definition, affirmation, revision, and growth, a process that is the image, we may say, of the life process.\\u201d\",\n          \"genre\": \"Poetry\",\n          \"id\": 192,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=tBMN6gmiA6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 866,\n          \"pub_year\": 1998,\n          \"title\": \"The Collected Poems of Robert Penn Warren\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Selected Letters of Robert Penn Warren, Volume three, provides an indispensable glimpse of Warren the writer and the man, covering a crucial decade in his life.

The period 1943\\u20131952 also saw the publication of \\u201cA Poem of Pure Imagination\\u201d; World Enough and Time; The Ballad of Billie Potts; At Heaven's Gate; and Selected Poems, 1923\\u20131943. Warren's letters shed new light on those works and on his close relationship with his editors Lambert Davis and Albert Erskine. Included too is correspondence concerning Warren's collaboration with Robert Rossen on the movie production of All the King's Men, which received the Academy Award for best picture in 1949. The list of friends and colleagues with whom Warren communicated reads like a roll call of major twentieth-century literary figures and clearly shows his ever-widening influence on the world of letters. Spanning a remarkable range in both style and tone, the letters disclose Warren's attitudes toward his work as a teacher and his thoughts on the events of World War II, the Korean War, and the political conflicts in postwar Europe.

He is regarded as a key transitional figure between literary realism and literary modernism, and is considered by many to be among the greatest novelists in the English language. He was the son of Henry James Sr. and the brother of philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James.\\nHe is best known for his novels dealing with the social and marital interplay between \\u00e9migr\\u00e9 Americans, English people, and continental Europeans. Examples of such novels include The Portrait of a Lady, The Ambassadors, and The Wings of the Dove. His later works were increasingly experimental. In describing the internal states of mind and social dynamics of his characters, James often wrote in a style in which ambiguous or contradictory motives and impressions were overlaid or juxtaposed in the discussion of a character's psyche. For their unique ambiguity, as well as for other aspects of their composition, his late works have been compared to impressionist painting.His novella The Turn of the Screw has garnered a reputation as the most analysed and ambiguous ghost story in the English language and remains his most widely adapted work in other media. He also wrote other highly regarded ghost stories.\\nJames published articles and books of criticism, travel, biography, autobiography, and plays. Born in the United States, James largely relocated to Europe as a young man, and eventually settled in England, becoming a British citizen in 1915, a year before his death. James was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912, and 1916.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Henry James wrote with an imperial elegance of style, whether his subjects were American innocents or European sophisticates, incandescent women or their vigorous suitors.

The entirely new Portable Henry James provides an unparalleled range of this great body of work: seven major tales, including Daisy Miller, The Turn of the Screw, \\\"The Beast in the Jungle,\\\" and \\\"The Jolly Corner\\\"; a sampling of revisions James made to some of his most famous work; travel writing; literary criticism; correspondences; autobiography; descriptions of the major novels; and parodies by famous contemporaries, including T.

Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and attention to practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs.Thoreau was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr.Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist. In \\\"Civil Disobedience\\\", Thoreau wrote: \\\"I heartily accept the motto,\\u2014'That government is best which governs least;' and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,\\u2014'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. ...

In 1923, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for One of Ours, a novel set during World War I.\\nWilla Cather and her family moved from Virginia to Webster County, Nebraska, when she was nine years old. The family later settled in the town of Red Cloud.  Shortly after graduating from the University of Nebraska\\u2013Lincoln, Cather moved to Pittsburgh for ten years, supporting herself as a magazine editor and high school English teacher. At the age of 33, she moved to New York City, her primary home for the rest of her life, though she also traveled widely and spent considerable time at her summer residence on Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick. She spent the last 39 years of her life with her domestic partner, Edith Lewis, before being diagnosed with breast cancer and dying of a cerebral hemorrhage. She is buried beside Lewis in a Jaffrey, New Hampshire plot.\\nCather achieved recognition as a novelist of the frontier and pioneer experience. She wrote of the spirit of those settlers moving into the western states, many of them European immigrants in the nineteenth century. Common themes in her work include nostalgia and exile.

His economical and understated style\\u2014which included his iceberg theory\\u2014had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.\\nHemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for The Kansas City Star before leaving for the Italian Front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).\\nIn 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of four wives. They moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s' \\\"Lost Generation\\\" expatriate community. Hemingway's debut novel The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927, and married Pauline Pfeiffer. They divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War (1936\\u20131939), which he covered as a journalist and which was the basis for his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940. He and Gellhorn separated after he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris.\\nHe maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida (in the 1930s) and in Cuba (in the 1940s and 1950s). He almost died in 1954 after two plane crashes on successive days, with injuries leaving him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life.

Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick (1851); Typee (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia; and Billy Budd, Sailor, a posthumously published novella. Although his reputation was not high at the time of his death, the 1919 centennial of his birth was the starting point of a Melville revival, and Moby-Dick grew to be considered one of the great American novels.\\nMelville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant whose death in 1832 left the family in dire financial straits. He took to sea in 1839 as a common sailor on a merchant ship and then on the whaler Acushnet, but he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands. Typee, his first book, and its sequel, Omoo (1847), were travel-adventures based on his encounters with the peoples of the islands. Their success gave him the financial security to marry Elizabeth Shaw, the daughter of the Boston jurist Lemuel Shaw. Mardi (1849), a romance-adventure and his first book not based on his own experience, was not well received. Redburn (1849) and White-Jacket (1850), both tales based on his experience as a well-born young man at sea, were given respectable reviews, but did not sell well enough to support his expanding family.\\nMelville's growing literary ambition showed in Moby-Dick (1851), which took nearly a year and a half to write, but it did not find an audience, and critics scorned his psychological novel Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852). From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, including \\\"Benito Cereno\\\" and \\\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\\". In 1857, he traveled to England, toured the Near East, and published his last work of prose, The Confidence-Man (1857). He moved to New York in 1863, eventually taking a position as a United States customs inspector.\\nFrom that point, Melville focused his creative powers on poetry. Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866) was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the American Civil War. In 1867, his eldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. Melville's metaphysical epic Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land was published in 1876. In 1886, his other son Stanwix died of apparent tuberculosis, and Melville retired. During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, and left one volume unpublished. The novella Billy Budd was left unfinished at his death, but was published posthumously in 1924. Melville died from cardiovascular disease in 1891.\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Herman Melville (1819-91) brought as much genius to the smaller-scale literary forms as he did to the full-blown novel: his poems and the short stories and novellas collected in this volume reveal a deftness and a delicacy of touch that is in some ways even more impressive than the massive, tectonic passions of Moby-Dick. In a story like \\\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\\" -- one of the very few perfect representatives of the form in the English language -- he displayed an unflinching precision and insight and empathy in his depiction of the drastically alienated inner life of the title character. In \\\"Benito Cereno,\\\" he addressed the great racial dilemmas of the nineteenth century with a profound, almost surreal imaginative clarity. And in Billy, Budd, Sailor, the masterpiece of his last years, he fused the knowledge and craft gained from a lifetime's magnificent work into a pure, stark, flawlessly composed tale of innocence betrayed and destroyed. Melville is justly honored for the epic sweep of his mind, but his lyricism, his skill in rendering the minute, the particular, the local, was equally sublime.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 176,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=sr3bEI3iYusC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 522,\n          \"pub_year\": 1997,\n          \"title\": \"Complete Shorter Fiction of Herman Melville\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"A new, definitive edition of Herman Melville\\u2019s virtuosic short stories\\u2014American classics wrought with scorching fury, grim humor, and profound beauty Though best-known for his epic masterpiece Moby-Dick, Herman Melville also left a body of short stories arguably unmatched in American fiction.

Hart Crane, one of the first to recognize Anderson\\u2019s genius, quickly hailed his accomplishment: \\u201cAmerica should read this book on her knees.\\u201d Here\\u2013\\u2013for the first time in a single volume\\u2013\\u2013are all the collections Anderson published during his lifetime: Winesburg, Ohio (1919), The Triumph of the Egg (1921), Horses and Men (1923), and Death in the Woods (1933), along with a generous selection of stories left uncollected or unpublished at his death. Exploring the hidden recesses of small town life, these haunting, understated, often sexually frank stories pivot on seemingly quiet moments when lives change, futures are recast, and pasts come to reckon. They transformed the tone of American storytelling, inspiring writers like Hemingway, Faulkner, and Mailer, and defining a tradition of midwestern fiction that includes Charles Baxter, editor of this volume.

After college, Carol earns a position as a librarian in the state capital city, yet finds the work to be unsatisfying. This is why she agrees when her new husband, a doctor named Will, asks if they can move to his small hometown. However, soon after Will and Carol arrive in the rural town, Carol finds herself immensely disappointed in the scenery and culture. The architecture of the town is ugly and bland, and is decorated to match. Meanwhile, its occupants hold a high level of snooty conservatism, and immediately disapprove of Carol for being a working woman. Because Carol loves her husband and loves to help, she becomes determined to lead a reform for the town by cleaning up the streets and educating the people. However, as Carol attempts to start progressive clubs and tries to make friends, every idea she has is disregarded and disrespected by the town\\u2019s prominent cliques.

The vehicle in Lewis\\u2019s novel, not a Model T but a Gomez-Dep roadster, takes Claire Boltwood and her father from Minnesota to Seattle, exposing them all to the perils of early motoring. On the road, the upper-crust Boltwoods are at once more insignificant and more noble.

She portrayed racial struggles in the early-1900s American South and published research on hoodoo. The most popular of her four novels is Their Eyes Were Watching God, published in 1937. She also wrote more than 50 short stories, plays, and essays.\\nHurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, and moved with her family to Eatonville, Florida, in 1894. She later used Eatonville as the setting for many of her stories.\\nIn her early career, Hurston conducted anthropological and ethnographic research while a student at Barnard College and Columbia University. She had an interest in African-American and Caribbean folklore, and how these contributed to the community's identity.\\nShe also wrote fiction about contemporary issues in the Black community and became a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance. Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and racial division, were published in anthologies such as The New Negro and Fire!! After moving back to Florida, Hurston wrote and published her literary anthology on African-American folklore in North Florida, Mules and Men (1935), and her first three novels: Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934); Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937); and Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939). Also published during this time was Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti.\\nHurston's works concerned both the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades. In 1975, fifteen years after Hurston's death, interest in her work was revived after author Alice Walker published an article, \\\"In Search of Zora Neale Hurston\\\" (later retitled \\u201cLooking for Zora\\u201d), in the March issue of Ms. magazine that year.  Then, in 2001, Hurston's manuscript Every Tongue Got to Confess, a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published after being discovered in the Smithsonian archives.

His books have more than 50 million copies in print worldwide, including The Fault in Our Stars (2012), which is one of the best-selling books of all time. Green's rapid rise to fame and idiosyncratic voice are credited with creating a major shift in the young adult fiction market. Aside from being a novelist, Green is well known for his work in online video, most notably his YouTube ventures with his brother Hank Green.\\nBorn in Indianapolis, Indiana, Green was raised in Orlando, Florida, before attending boarding school outside of Birmingham, Alabama, graduating in 1995. He attended Kenyon College, graduating with a double major in English and religious studies in 2000. Green then spent six months as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. He was deeply affected by the difficult experience, which later partially inspired The Fault in Our Stars. Green reconsidered his path and began working at Booklist in Chicago while writing his first novel. His debut novel Looking for Alaska (2005) was awarded the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award. While living in New York City, Green published his second novel, An Abundance of Katherines (2006), which became a Printz Honor book. Starting on January 1, 2007, John and his brother Hank launched the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel, a series of vlogs submitted to one another on alternating weekdays; the videos spawned an active online-based community called Nerdfighteria and an annual telethon-style fundraiser called Project for Awesome, both of which have persisted and grown over time.\\nJohn moved back to Indianapolis in 2007, and published three novels over the next three years: Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances (2008, with Maureen Johnson and Lauren Myracle), his third solo novel, Paper Towns (2008), and Will Grayson, Will Grayson (2010, with David Levithan). From 2010 to 2013, John and Hank launched several online video projects: VidCon, an annual conference for the online video community; Crash Course (2011\\u2013present), a wide-ranging educational channel; and Subbable, a crowdfunding platform which was purchased by Patreon in 2015. Green's 2012 novel, The Fault in Our Stars, proved to be a massive success. The book created a passionate fan base of readers and debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's chapter books, remaining in the top ten for over two-and-a-half years. The 2014 film adaptation was also a commercial and critical success, leading to several other film and television adaptations of his work. That same year, Green was included in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2015, the weekly comedy podcast Dear Hank & John (2015\\u2013present) debuted, co-hosted by the Green brothers.\\nGreen's subsequent projects, his novel Turtles All the Way Down (2017) and The Anthropocene Reviewed (2018\\u20132021), dealt more directly with his own struggles with anxiety and obsessive\\u2013compulsive disorder. The Anthropocene Reviewed began as a podcast in January 2018, with Green reviewing different facets of the Anthropocene on a five-star scale. Green later adapted the essays into his first nonfiction book, The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet (2021). The essays were ordered chronologically through his life to give the approximate structure of a memoir. John has also collaborated with his wife, art curator Sarah Urist Green, on the video series The Art Assignment (2017\\u20132020) and Ours Poetica (2019\\u2013present), which focus on visual art and poetry respectively.

With the explosion of knowledge taking place in recent decades, scientists are constantly discovering that things they have been certain about are wrong: the continents they thought had been in place forever actually drift around; the cells we are made of are not simple but infinitely complex; our genus has been on Earth many times longer than they thought. And increasingly there is compelling evidence that scientists are wrong about our living relatives. One thing considered certain was that the giants and wildmen in stories from all over the world are entirely imaginary. Now that belief is under serious challenge. Forty-five years ago giant footprints found in northern California brought Bigfoot to the attention of Americans and revived interest in Canada's Sasquatch. Every year since then additional evidence has accumulated, and now that witnesses can submit information via the internet the trickle of reports has become a flood. John Green has been in the thick of things from the beginning. In Sasquatch, The Apes Among Us, first published in 1978, he sampled the evidence from the earliest records up the late 1970s and from all around the world, then concentrated on two aspects of the subject: the nature of the animal described and the wealth of reports from parts of North America outside the Pacific Northwest. When it came out The Apes Among Us was acclaimed as the definitive work on the fascinating subject of whether humans share North America with a giant bipedal primate that is unknown to science. Since then evidence for the existence of that unknown primate has grown exponentially, and individual scientists have written books about aspects of it. Remarkably, however, to most of the scientific world the evidence remains unknown and unexplored, and for those who do follow the subject this is still the definitive book.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 232,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Te3WAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 500,\n          \"pub_year\": 2017,\n          \"title\": \"Sasquatch\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"description\": \"American author and vlogger\",\n      \"id\": 52,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/John_Green_2020_%28C6txQ5yn5S8%29.jpg\",\n      \"name\": \"John Green\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"bio\": \"Alice Sebold (born September 6, 1963) is an American author.

His fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, genres and themes, including history, music, science, and mathematics. For Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon won the 1973 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.Hailing from Long Island, Pynchon served two years in the United States Navy and earned an English degree from Cornell University. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known: V. (1963), The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), and Gravity's Rainbow (1973). His 2009 novel Inherent Vice was adapted into a feature film of the same name by director Paul Thomas Anderson in 2014. Pynchon is notoriously reclusive from the media; few photographs of him have been published, and rumors about his location and identity have circulated since the 1960s, although he voiced himself in two episodes of The Simpsons. Pynchon's most recent novel, Bleeding Edge, was published on September 17, 2013.\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Reluctantly investigating a kidnapping threat against his ex-girlfriend's billionaire beau, Doc Sportello tackles a bizarre tangle of nefarious characters before stumbling on a mysterious entity that may actually be a tax shelter for a dental group.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 238,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z-dvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 381,\n          \"pub_year\": 2014,\n          \"title\": \"Inherent Vice\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Compiling five short stories originally written between 1959 and 1964, Slow Learner showcases Thomas Pynchon\\u2019s writing before the publication of his first novel V.

Born in Imperial Russia in 1899, Nabokov wrote his first nine novels in Russian (1926\\u20131938) while living in Berlin, where he met his wife. He achieved international acclaim and prominence after moving to the United States, where he began writing in English. Nabokov became an American citizen in 1945 and lived mostly on the East Coast before returning to Europe in 1961, where he settled in Montreux, Switzerland.\\nFrom 1948 to 1959, Nabokov was a professor of Russian literature at Cornell University.Nabokov's 1955 novel Lolita ranked fourth on Modern Library's list of the 100 best 20th-century novels in 2007 and is considered one of the greatest 20th-century works of literature. Nabokov's Pale Fire, published in 1962, was ranked 53rd on the same list. His memoir, Speak, Memory, published in 1951, is considered among the greatest nonfiction works of the 20th century, placing eighth on Random House's ranking of 20th century works.

He is known for his graphic depictions of violence and his unique writing style, recognizable by a sparse use of punctuation and attribution. McCarthy is widely regarded as one of the greatest contemporary American writers.McCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, although he was raised primarily in Tennessee. In 1951, he enrolled in the University of Tennessee, but dropped out to join the US Air Force. His debut novel, The Orchard Keeper, was published in 1965. Awarded literary grants, McCarthy was able to travel to southern Europe, where he wrote his second novel, Outer Dark (1968). Suttree (1979), like his other early novels, received generally positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. A MacArthur Fellowship enabled him to travel to the American Southwest, where he researched and wrote his  fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985). Although it garnered a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since been regarded as his magnum opus, with some labeling it the Great American Novel.\\nMcCarthy first experienced widespread success with All the Pretty Horses (1992), for which he received both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was followed by The Crossing (1994) and Cities of the Plain (1998), completing the Border Trilogy. His 2005 novel No Country for Old Men received mixed reviews. His 2006 novel The Road won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction. Many of McCarthy's works have been adapted into film. No Country for Old Men was adapted into a 2007 film, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and Child of God have also been adapted into films, while Outer Dark was turned into a 15-minute short. McCarthy had a play adapted into a 2011 film, The Sunset Limited.\\nMcCarthy works with  the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a multidisciplinary research center. At the SFI, he published the essay \\\"The Kekul\\u00e9 Problem\\\" (2017), which explores the human unconscious and the origin of language. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012. His most recent novels, The Passenger and Stella Maris, were published on October 25, 2022, and December 6, 2022, respectively.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [],\n      \"description\": \"American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter\",\n      \"id\": 56,\n      \"image_url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Cormac_McCarthy_%28Child_of_God_author_portrait_-_high-res%29.jpg\",\n      \"name\": \"Cormac McCarthy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"bio\": \"David Foster Wallace (February 21, 1962 \\u2013 September 12, 2008) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and university professor of English and creative writing.

He garnered acclaim for his work across several mediums, including essays, novels, plays, and poems. His first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, was published in 1953; decades later, Time magazine included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels released from 1923 to 2005. His first essay collection, Notes of a Native Son, was published in 1955.Baldwin's work fictionalizes fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures. Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race, and class intertwine to create intricate narratives that run parallel with some of the major political movements toward social change in mid-twentieth century America, such as the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement. Baldwin's protagonists are often but not exclusively African American, and gay and bisexual men frequently feature prominently in his literature. These characters often face internal and external obstacles in their search for social and self-acceptance. Such dynamics are prominent in Baldwin's second novel, Giovanni's Room, which was written in 1956, well before the gay liberation movement.His reputation has endured since his death and his work has been adapted for the screen to great acclaim. An unfinished manuscript, Remember This House, was expanded and adapted for cinema as the documentary film I Am Not Your Negro (2016), which was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 89th Academy Awards. One of his novels, If Beale Street Could Talk, was adapted into the Academy Award\\u2013 winning film of the same name in 2018, directed and produced by Barry Jenkins.In addition to writing, Baldwin was also a well-known, and controversial, public figure and orator, especially during the civil rights movement in the United States.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Never before available, the unexpurgated last interview with James Baldwin \\u201cI was not born to be what someone said I was.

Haley had requested that David Stevens, a screenwriter, complete it; the book was published as Queen: The Story of an American Family. It was adapted as a miniseries, Alex Haley's Queen, broadcast in 1993.\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"This \\\"bold...extraordinary...blockbuster...\\\" (Newsweek magazine) begins with a birth in an African village in 1750, and ends two centuries later at a funeral in Arkansas. And in that time span, an unforgettable cast of men, women, and children come to life, many of them based on the people from Alex Haley's own family tree. When Alex Haley was a boy growing up in Tennessee, his grandmother used to tell him stories about their family, stories that went way back to a man she called \\\"the African\\\" who was taken aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America. As an adult, Alex Haley spent twelve years searching for documentation that might authenticate what his grandmother had told him. In an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered the name of \\\"the African\\\"--Kunta Kinte, as well as the exact location of the village in West Africa from where he was abducted in 1767. While Haley created certain unknown details of his family history, ROOTS is definitely based on the facts of his ancestry, and the six generations of people--slaves and freedmen, farmers and lawyers, an architect, teacher--and one acclaimed author--descended from Kunte Kinte. But with this book, Haley did more than recapture the history of his own family. He popularized genealogy for people of all races and colors; and in so doing, wrote one of the most important and beloved books of all time, a true Modern Classic.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Fiction\",\n          \"id\": 266,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Atgzeh0D9QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 704,\n          \"pub_year\": 2000,\n          \"title\": \"Roots\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"This is a very special novel that sparkles with the same memorable writing that made ROOTS an American classic. This is the story of Fletcher Randall, a nineteen-year-old from North Carolina whose politically powerful father is a plantation owner, and, of course, a slave owner. The time is 1855, and all Fletcher Randall knows and believes about slavery he's learned from his father. But Fletcher goes to school up North, and one or two of his Princeton classmates talk about how wrong slavery is until Fletcher begins to think for himself --and he becomes a traitor to his background, to his family, by conspiring to aid in a mass escape of slaves on the Underground Railroad. His partner in this plan is a black slave by the name of Harpin' John, a man who plays the harmonica so sweetly it could make a grown man cry. Christmas Eve is the secret date set for the escape. How these two men of such incredibly opposing backgrounds join together to achieve the goal of freedom makes A Different Kind of Christmas soar with unforgettable inspiration.

Ellis was first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack and is a self-proclaimed satirist whose trademark technique, as a writer, is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style. His novels commonly share recurring characters.When Ellis was 21, his first novel, the controversial bestseller Less than Zero (1985), was published by Simon & Schuster. His third novel, American Psycho (1991), was his most successful. Upon its release the literary establishment widely condemned it as overly violent and misogynistic. Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster, the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year. Ellis's novels have become increasingly metafictional. Lunar Park (2005), a pseudo-memoir and ghost story, received positive reviews. Imperial Bedrooms (2010), marketed as a sequel to Less than Zero, continues in this vein. The Shards (2023) is a fictionalized memoir of Ellis's final year of high school in 1981 in Los Angeles.Four of Ellis's works have been made into films. Less than Zero was adapted in 1987 as a film of the same name, but the film bore little resemblance to the novel. Mary Harron's adaptation of American Psycho was released in 2000. Roger Avary's adaptation of The Rules of Attraction was released in 2002. The Informers, co-written by Ellis and based on his collection of short stories, was released in 2008. Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the 2013 film The Canyons.\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER \\u2022 In this modern classic, the acclaimed New York Times bestselling author explores the incomprehensible depths of madness and captures the insanity of violence in our time or any other.

For Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon won the 1973 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.Hailing from Long Island, Pynchon served two years in the United States Navy and earned an English degree from Cornell University. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known: V.

He rose to prominence with the publication of Hell's Angels (1967), a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle club to write a first-hand account of their lives and experiences.\\nIn 1970, he wrote an unconventional magazine feature titled \\\"The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved\\\" for Scanlan's Monthly, which raised his profile and established his counterculture credibility. It also set him on the path to establishing his own subgenre of New Journalism that he called \\\"Gonzo\\\", a journalistic style in which the writer becomes a central figure and participant in the events of the narrative.\\nThompson remains best known for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971), a book first serialized in Rolling Stone in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement. It was adapted for film twice: loosely in Where the Buffalo Roam starring Bill Murray as Thompson in 1980, and explicitly in 1998 by director Terry Gilliam in the eponymous film starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro.\\nThompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado, in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket. His campaign was chronicled in the documentary film Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb. He became known for his dislike of Richard Nixon, who he claimed represented \\\"that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character\\\". He covered Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72.\\nThompson's output declined from the mid-1970s, as he struggled with the consequences of fame, and complained that he could no longer merely report on events, as he was too easily recognized. After several high-profile stories were quashed by the upper management of Rolling Stone, he found it increasingly difficult to get his work into mainstream outlets. He did continue to write for alternative newspapers, and had a gig as a critic for the mainstream San Francisco Examiner for much of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Most of his work from 1979 to 1994 was collected in The Gonzo Papers. He continued to write for various journalism outlets in a variety of formats, including sporadic stories published in Rolling Stone and a weekly column that appeared on ESPN.com's Page 2 titled \\\"Hey, Rube\\\" that he started in 2000.\\nHe was known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal narcotics, his love of firearms, and his iconoclastic contempt for authority. He often remarked: \\\"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.\\\" Thompson died by suicide at the age of 67, following a series of health problems. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired out of a cannon in a ceremony funded by his friend Johnny Depp and attended by friends including then-Senator John Kerry and Jack Nicholson. Hari Kunzru wrote, \\\"The true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist ... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him.\\\"\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"Hunter S.

She is considered by scholars to have been a forerunner of American 20th-century feminist authors of Southern or Catholic background, such as Zelda Fitzgerald, and she is one of the more frequently read and recognized writers of Louisiana Creole heritage. She is best known today for her 1899 novel The Awakening.\\nOf maternal French and paternal Irish descent, Chopin was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She married and moved with her husband to New Orleans. They later lived in the country in Cloutierville, Louisiana. From 1892 to 1895, Chopin wrote short stories for both children and adults that were published in national magazines, including Atlantic Monthly, Vogue, The Century Magazine, and The Youth's Companion. Her stories aroused controversy because of her subjects and her approach; they were condemned as immoral by some critics.\\nHer major works were two short story collections and two novels. The collections are Bayou Folk (1894) and A Night in Acadie (1897). Her important short stories included \\\"D\\u00e9sir\\u00e9e's Baby\\\" (1893), a tale of miscegenation in antebellum Louisiana, \\\"The Story of an Hour\\\" (1894), and \\\"The Storm\\\" (written 1898, first published 1969). (\\\"The Storm\\\" is a sequel to \\\"At the Cadian Ball (1892),\\\" which appeared in Bayou Folk, her first collection of short stories.)Chopin also wrote two novels: At Fault (1890) and The Awakening (1899), which are set in New Orleans and Grand Isle, respectively. The characters in her stories are usually residents of Louisiana, and many are Creoles of various ethnic or racial backgrounds. Many of her works are set in Natchitoches in north-central Louisiana, a region where she lived.\\nWithin a decade of her death, Chopin was widely recognized as one of the leading writers of her time. In 1915, Fred Lewis Pattee wrote \\\"some of [Chopin's] work is equal to the best that has been produced in France or even in America. [She displayed] what may be described as a native aptitude for narration amounting almost to genius.\\\"\\n\\n\",\n      \"books\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"The groundbreaking depiction of a woman who dares to defy the expectations of society in the pursuit of her desire, with an insightful introduction by author Claire Vaye Watkins.

But a century after her death, The Awakening is widely regarded as Kate Chopin's great achievement and a celebrated work of early feminist literature.

Simply as a travel book, the reader finds remarkable descriptions, such as one in which Bellow finds \\\"the melting air\\\" of Jerusalem pressing upon him \\\"with an almost human weight\\\" Something intelligible is communicated by the earthlike colors of this most beautiful of cities. The impression that Bellow offers is that living in Israel must be as exhausting as it is exciting: a murderous barrage on the nerves. Israel, he writes, \\\"is both a garrison state and a cultivated society, both Spartan and Athenian. It tries to do everything, to make provisions for everything. All resources, all faculties are strained. Unremitting thought about the world situation parallels the defense effort.\\\" Jerusalem's people are actively and individually involved in universal history. Bellow makes you share in the experience.\",\n          \"genre\": \"Travel\",\n          \"id\": 297,\n          \"image_url\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=exMBCR5FZBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"page_count\": 240,\n          \"pub_year\": 2010,\n          \"title\": \"To Jerusalem and Back\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"description\": \"\\\"The best novel to come out of America\\u2014or England\\u2014for a generation.\\\" \\u2014V.S.

Most of his best known work is speculative fiction, but he also worked in other genres, such as the coming of age novel Dandelion Wine (1957) and the fictionalized memoir Green Shadows, White Whale (1992). He also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including Moby Dick and It Came from Outer Space.

In this landmark volume, America's preeminent storyteller offers us one hundred treasures from alifetime of words and ideas -- tales that amaze, enthrall, and horrify; breathtaking journeys backward and forward in time; classic stories with the undiminished power to tantalize, mystify, elate, and move the reader to tears. Each small gem in the master's collection remains as dazzling as when it first appeared in print. There is magic in these pages: the wonders of interstellar flight, a conspiracy of insects, the early bloom of love in the warmth of August. Both the world of Ray Bradbury and its people are vivid and alive, as colorfully unique as a poker chip hand-painted by a brilliant artist or as warmly familiar as the well-used settings on a family's dining room table. In a poor man's desire for the stars, in the twisted night games of a hateful embalmer, in a magnificent fraud perpetrated to banish despair and repair a future, in a writer's wonderful death is the glowing proof of the timeless artistry of one of America's greatest living bards. The one hundred stories in this volume were chosen by Bradbury himself, and span a career that blossomed in the pulp magazines of the early 1940s and continues to flourish in the new millennium. Here are representatives of the legendary author's finest works of short fiction, including many that have not been republished for decades, all forever fresh and vital, evocative and immensely entertaining.

He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s.\\nKesey was born in La Junta, Colorado, and grew up in Springfield, Oregon, graduating from the University of Oregon in 1957. He began writing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1960 after completing a graduate fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later. During this period, Kesey participated in government studies involving hallucinogenic drugs (including mescaline and LSD) to supplement his income.After One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was published, Kesey moved to nearby La Honda, California, and began hosting happenings with former colleagues from Stanford, miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures (most notably Neal Cassady) and other friends collectively known as the Merry Pranksters; these parties, known as Acid Tests, integrated the consumption of LSD with multimedia performances. He mentored the Grateful Dead (the Acid Tests' de facto house band) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their career.\\nKesey's second novel, Sometimes a Great Notion\\u2014an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the modernist grandeur of William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha saga\\u2014was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964. Kesey regarded it as his magnum opus.In 1965, after an arrest for marijuana possession and faking suicide, Kesey was imprisoned for five months. Shortly thereafter, he returned home to the Willamette Valley and settled in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, where he maintained a secluded, family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life. In addition to teaching at the University of Oregon\\u2014an experience that culminated in Caverns (1989), a collaborative novel by Kesey and his graduate workshop students under the pseudonym \\\"O.U. Levon\\\"\\u2014he continued to regularly contribute fiction and reportage to such publications as Esquire, Rolling Stone, Oui, Running, and The Whole Earth Catalog; various iterations of these pieces were collected in Kesey's Garage Sale (1973) and Demon Box (1986).\\nBetween 1974 and 1980, Kesey published six issues of Spit in the Ocean, a literary magazine that featured excerpts from an unfinished novel (Seven Prayers by Grandma Whittier, an account of Kesey's grandmother's struggle with Alzheimer's disease) and contributions from writers including Margo St. James, Kate Millett, Stewart Brand, Saul-Paul Sirag, Jack Sarfatti, Paul Krassner and William S. Burroughs. After a third novel (Sailor Song) was released to lukewarm reviews in 1992, he reunited with the Merry Pranksters and began publishing works on the Internet until ill health (including a stroke) curtailed his activities.\",\n    \"books\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"The magnificent second novel from the legendary author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Following the astonishing success of his first novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ken Kesey wrote what Charles Bowden calls \\\"one of the few essential books written by an American in the last half century.\\\" This wild-spirited tale tells of a bitter strike that rages through a small lumber town along the Oregon coast. Bucking that strike out of sheer cussedness are the Stampers. Out of the Stamper family's rivalries and betrayals Ken Kesey has crafted a novel with the mythic impact of Greek tragedy.
